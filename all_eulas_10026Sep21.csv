The Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary by jurisdiction.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND CONSISTENT WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YUBICO DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE PRODUCT, THE SERVICE, AND ANY SOFTWARE, PROCEDURE, METHOD, APPARATUS, TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR PROCESS PROVIDED TO YOU IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. YUBICO, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS DO NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCT, THE SERVICE OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ANY DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED TO USER. G. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL YUBICOS AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND EMPLOYEES TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCT. IN NO EVENT WILL YUBICO, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF LOST REVENUE, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOST BUSINESS REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, ECONOMIC LOSS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR ANY CLAIM AGAINST USER BY ANY OTHER PARTY. The foregoing limitations will apply even if any warranty or remedy provided under this Agreement fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. H. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Yubico and its affiliates harmless from and against any third party claim, demand, cause of action, damage, loss, liability, suit, proceeding, judgment, or cost (including attorney fees), brought against Yubico, its affiliates, employees, resellers or distributors which is based on your use of the Product or the Service. I. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of Yubicos order confirmation and shall continue until terminated as set forth below. However, our Privacy Notice and Cookie Notice may remain in effect even after expiry or termination of the Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice or action by Yubico if you breach any material term or condition of this Agreement. (b) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice or action by Yubico in the event user becomes insolvent or makes an assignment of this Agreement for the benefit of creditors or if any other bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against user. J. Right to Cancel. Yubico Return and Cancellation Policy K. Changes. Yubico reserves the right at any time and at its own discretion to change the terms and conditions of this Agreement as it applies to future purchases of Products. The Privacy Notice and Cookie Notice may be changed from time to time in accordance with what is stated therein. L. Choice of Law and Venue. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to the laws of (i) the State of California, U.S.A. if you obtained the Product from Yubico, Inc.; and (ii) Sweden if you obtained the Product from Yubico AB. In either event, the choice of law shall be without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Furthermore, both parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of California when California law applies and the courts located in Sweden when the laws of Sweden apply. M. Other. The terms and conditions set forth or referenced herein constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and Yubico and supersede all prior representations and agreements with respect to the subject matter herein. This Agreement, including all rights and licenses granted herein, is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you and any attempt to do so shall be null and void. Any notice, report, approval or consent required or permitted hereunder must be in writing. The waiver by Yubico of a breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of this Agreement; nor shall any delay by Yubico to exercise any right under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any such right. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. The parties agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely affecting Yubicos proprietary or intellectual property rights in the Yubico Service or Product, including the Software, would cause irreparable injury to Yubico and its affiliates for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that Yubico therefore shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief (without the requirement to post a bond) to address such a breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have hereunder or at law.

You hereby acknowledge that you are aware of California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides as follows A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. With full awareness and understanding of the above provisions, you hereby waive any rights you may have under Section 1542, as well as under any other statutes or common law principles of similar effect. Payment You agree to the fees and charges and other pricing terms applicable to your use of the Service as specified in these Terms of Use and as otherwise communicated to you through the Service, including any applicable Fees (defined below) and Service Charges (defined below). All fees and charges paid by Users in connection with the Service are nonrefundable, except as expressly stated in these Terms of Use. LiquidSpace may change the fees and charges for the Service at any time in its sole discretion. If you are a Guest and you have been duly authorized to book the Space by the Host, when you complete a reservation for a Space on the Service, you agree to pay the applicable fee for using the Space as set forth in the offering for such Space (the Fee) based on the type of reservation booked (i.e. Hourly Reservation vs. Monthly Reservation (each, defined below)). The Fee for an Hourly Reservation is the rate per hour of the reservation and the Fee for a Monthly Reservation is the rate per calendar month of the reservation. Hourly Reservations are reservations with duration of 24 hours or less including any reservations made for a full day, as well as recurring reservations where each individual reservation is a full day or less. Monthly Reservations are reservations with a minimum duration of one calendar month, including reservations that automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis. You will be billed the Fee through one of the two following options, as determined by the Host (1) LiquidSpace will ask for your credit card information and billing address or other payment information, and LiquidSpace will process your Fee payment on behalf of the Host (the LiquidSpace Billing Option), or (2) the Host will bill you directly for the Fee, and the Host will process your Fee payment directly (the Host Billing Option). Under the LiquidSpace Billing Option, LiquidSpace is acting as the Hosts limited payment collection agent, and the Fee paid through this option shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host. The amount and timing of the Fee payments processed by LiquidSpace on behalf of the Host is based on the type of reservation booked. For Hourly Reservations booked under the LiquidSpace Billing Option, LiquidSpace will process payment for such reservations 24 hours before the reservation starts. For Hourly Reservations, you will be charged the Fee for the total number of hours booked including any taxes as set forth in the offering for the Space (the Hourly Reservation Payment). Any changes you make to your reservation after it is made may result in an adjustment to the Hourly Reservation Payment for the reservation subject to the Cancellation Terms (defined below). In the event you use the Space for longer than the amount of time you booked for your reservation, the applicable Host may adjust the Hourly Reservation Payment for your reservation based on your actual use of the Space. If you believe a change to your Hourly Reservation Payment made by a Host was in error, you may request a refund by providing notice to LiquidSpace through the Service. LiquidSpace may provide you a refund at LiquidSpaces sole discretion. Monthly Reservations may only be booked under the LiquidSpace Billing Option and require a minimum length of one calendar month. For Monthly Reservations, LiquidSpace will process the initial payment for such reservations within 24 hours after you complete your reservation on the Service. For Monthly Reservations, the initial payment will be equal to (1) the Setup Charge (as defined in the Space License Agreement), (2) (i) the Fee for the first full calendar month of the reservation (if you start your reservation on the first calendar day of the month), or (ii) a prorated portion of the Fee for the first partial month of the reservation (if you start your reservation after the first calendar day of the month), and (3) any applicable taxes. In addition, LiquidSpace will also process an additional amount equal to the Fee for a full calendar month (the Deposit). Renewals of Monthly Reservations, if any, shall be in accordance with the Space License Agreement. The Deposit will be collected by LiquidSpace on behalf of the Host and held for the benefit of the Guest and Host during the term of the reservation pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Space License Agreement. If you are a Host or a Professional, you acknowledge that LiquidSpace accepts payments from Guests as a limited collection agent for the Host and that LiquidSpaces obligation to pay the Host or a Professional is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. LiquidSpace does not guarantee payments to Hosts or Professionals for amounts that have not been successfully received by LiquidSpace from Guests. Any reservations that are cancelled by the Guest or by the Space at the Guest's request are subject to the Cancellation Terms.

Governing Law; Arbitration THIS SECTION INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND AN AGREEMENT THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY (AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING). PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BY FOLLOWING THE OPT OUT PROCEDURE DESCRIBED BELOW. Informal Process First You agree that if you have any dispute with LiquidSpace relating in any way to these Terms of Use or from access to or use of the Service, you will first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. Arbitration (Arbitration Agreement) If we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Use by binding arbitration. If you are an individual you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of the first of the date you access or use the Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and LiquidSpace are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. If you intend to seek arbitration, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must first send written notice to LiquidSpace of your intent to arbitrate (Notice). The Notice to LiquidSpace should be sent by sending the Notice by registered or certified mail to 2225 E. Bayshore Rd. Suite 200,Palo Alto, CA 94303. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. The arbitration will be administered by the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (CPR) under the CPR Rules for Administered Arbitration by a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in the County of Santa Clara, California, U.S.A. Each party will be responsible for paying any CPR, administrative and arbitrator fees (other than the initial filing fees) in accordance with CPR Rules, except that LiquidSpace will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed 75,000 and is nonfrivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with LiquidSpace and you are an individual, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to financeliquidspace.com within 30 days of the first of the date you access or use the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS GUEST IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND LIQUIDSPACE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of California and the FAA without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence, and will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in the County of Santa Clara, California, United States. You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. Indemnity You agree to indemnify and hold LiquidSpace harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of or in connection with any User Content you post or distribute on or through the Service, your use of or participation in the Service, your interactions with other Users of the Service, and any violation of these Terms of Use, the Space License Agreement, the Host Terms, the Professional Terms or of any law or the rights of any third party. Miscellaneous These Terms of Use, the Host Terms, the Professional Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and LiquidSpace regarding the use of the Service and supersede any prior agreements between you and LiquidSpace relating to your use of the Service. The failure of LiquidSpace to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use, the Host Terms or the Professional Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of these Terms of Use, the Host Terms or the Professional Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions. You may not assign, transfer or delegate in any manner these Terms of Use, the Host Terms or the Professional Terms or the rights and obligations hereunder or thereunder to any third party.

CD WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS LICENSE AND DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU MAY RECEIVE A FULL REFUND OF THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, THAT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IF YOU RETURN THE SOFTWARE UNUSED WITH PROOF OF PAYMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. 1. Grant of License. This Agreement grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsub licensable license to install and use, on the Device or a PC, as applicable, one (1) copy of the specified version of the Software in object code format as set out in the user documentation solely for your personal use. The Software is ""in use"" when it is loaded into the temporary or permanent memory (i.e. RAM, hard disk, etc.) of the PC or the Device. 2. Ownership. The Software is licensed and not sold to you. This Agreement grants you only the right to use the Software, but you do not acquire any rights, express or implied, in the Software other than those specified in this Agreement. TP VISION and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all patents, copyrights, EULAEnglish (UK) 1 1 trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights incorporated therein. The Software is protected by copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and other intellectual property laws. Therefore, other than as expressly set forth herein, you may not copy the Software without prior written authorization of TP VISION, except that you may make one (1) copy of the Software for your backup purposes only.

License Restrictions. Except as provided otherwise herein, you shall not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, or otherwise transfer the Software. You shall not, and you shall not permit any third party, to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except to the extent that applicable law expressly prohibits the foregoing restriction. You may not remove or destroy any product identification, copyright notices, or other proprietary markings or restrictions from the Software. All titles, trademarks, and copyright and restricted rights notices shall be reproduced on your back up copy of the Software. You may not modify or adapt the Software, merge the Software into another program or create derivative works based upon the Software. 4. Termination of certain functionality. The Software may contain components of certain licensed software including software licensed from Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) which implements Microsofts digital rights management technology for Windows Media. Content providers are using the digital rights management technology for Windows Media (WMDRM) to protect the integrity of their content (""Secure Content"") so that their intellectual property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Your Device may also use WMDRM software to transfer or play Secure Content (WMDRM Software). If the security of such WMDRM Software is compromised, Microsoft may revoke (either on its own or upon the request of the owners of Secure Content (""Secure Content Owners"")) the WMDRM Softwares right to acquire new licenses to copy, store, transfer, display andor play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the WMDRM Softwares ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked WM DRM Software is sent to your PC andor your Device whenever you download a license for Secure Content. Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your Device on behalf of Secure Content Owners, which may disable your Devices ability to copy, store, display, transfer, andor play Secure Content. Secure Content EULAEnglish (UK) 2 2 Owners may also require you to upgrade some of the WMDRM components distributed with this Software (WMDRM Upgrades) before accessing their content. When you attempt to play Secure Content, WMDRM Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a WMDRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the WMDRM Upgrade is downloaded. WMDRM Software built by TP VISION may do the same. If you decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access Secure Content that requires the WM DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. WMDRM features that access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses andor performing a required WMDRM Upgrade, can be switched off. When these features are switched off, you will still be able to play Secure Content if you have a valid license for such content already stored on your Device. However, you will not be able to use certain of the WMDRM Software features that require Internet access such as the ability to download content that requires the WMDRM Upgrade. All title and intellectual property rights in and to the Secure Content is the property of the respective Secure Content owners and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties. This Agreement grants you no rights to use such Secure Content. To summarize, if the Software contains Microsoft WMDRM components Secure Content you desire to download, copy, store, display, transfer, andor play is protected by the Microsoft WMDRM components of the Software. Microsoft, Secure Content Owners, or Secure Content distributors may deny you access, or restrict your access, to Secure Content even after you have paid for, andor obtained, it. Neither your consent nor the consent or approval of TP VISION is necessary for any of them to deny, withhold or otherwise restrict your access to Secure Content. TP VISION does not guaranty that you will be able to download, copy, store, display, transfer, andor play Secure Content. 5. Open Source Software.

Fees described below do not apply to authorized data vendors or information providers, whose fees for their own usage and redistribution of CGS data are calculated using a different pricing model. CUSIP Use of Service Statement The first step in the CGS licensing process is to complete and return a CUSIP Use of Service Statement (CUSIP UOSS). This allows CGS to understand how a potential customer plans on using the data contained within CGSs commercial databases. Fee Calculator 1.

If you operate more than 1 Business Line andor in more than 1 RegionCountry, the total annual License Fee is calculated by adding the applicable fees for additional Business Lines and RegionsCountries to the base fee. See fee model examples. Fee Structure The fees applicable to direct and indirect customers are the same and are based on the number of CGS identifiers databased (includes CUSIP, CGS CINS and CGS ISINs) The count should include all CGS Identifiers (except defunct and matured) regardless of where they are situated, to which a subscriber needs access in order to operate any part of their business. This definition applies whether the database is maintained directly by the subscriber or is maintained by a third party on behalf of, or for the benefit of, a subscriber. For example Subscriber may maintain a database (internal or outsourced) of 5,000 CGS Identifiers which reflects only those in which it holds, or at one time held, a position. However, if subscriber needs access to a pool of 30,000 CGS Identifiers in order to select those 5,000, it is the pool of 30,000 that should be counted. Conversely, if a subscriber receives a datafeed that includes 100,000 CGS Identifiers, but the pool from which they select CGS Identifiers to database is limited to only 10,000, then the count should be 10,000. Business Lines where CGS data is used Includes, but is not limited to Accounting Firm, Asset Management, AuditConsulting Firm, Bank Trust Services, Bank Other Services, BrokerDealer, Insurance Company, Investment Banking, Open Closed End Funds, RegulatorGovernment, and TreasuryPension. Regions in which a subscriber has access to or usage of a CGS database Geographic groupings that include, but are not limited to North America, South America, Europe, AsiaPacific, Africa and the Middle East. Additionally, the single fee covers the use of CUSIP, CGS CINS and CGS ISINs. Establishing the Base Fee To establish the base fee, CGS looks at the largest operating unit of the customer, i.e. the first Business Line and Region. If there is a second Business Line or Region, the additional fee equals 50 of the base fee for a Business Line andor Region. If there is a third or fourth Business Line or Region, the additional fee equals 75 of the base fee for a Business Lines andor Region. Combinations of Business Lines andor Regions yield further modifications to the base fee. See the Fee Model Tables for more information. Additional Notes No license fee required if the number of CGS identifiers databased by the client is fewer than 500. Once an indirect customer enters into a license agreement with CGS, the fee entitles that customer to access CGS data via multiple authorized data vendors or information providers without paying additional fees. There is no fee or license requirement imposed on customers who only readview CGS data via authorized vendors providers display terminals without download capability. Complimentary CGS services may be available with a CGS license; contact your Sales Representative for details. Final determination of fees is at the judgment of CGS and consideration will be given to aspects of a customers profile including, but not limited to Academiaresearch AUM for asset managers or fund managers US customers operating in one region of the country (e.g. the Midwest) Other equitable factors in the judgment of CGS. Fees are valid for the initial term of the customers subscription agreement, but may change on each anniversary date thereafter. Since 2009, annual fees have typically not exceeded 455,000. Unique circumstances for large, global financial institutions (multiple business lines, a distribution component to the business, etc.) may result in higher fees. CGS Licensing Policies FAQs When does a firm need to enter into a license agreement with CGS A license agreement with CGS is required when an enduser wishes to obtain access to an electronic download, datafeed or similar capability to retrieve CGS Data in bulk format of CUSIP standard numbers, CUSIP standard descriptions, CGS ISIN, CGS CINs numbers, and other information about financial instruments either directly from CGS or indirectly through one of CGS's many Authorized Distributors. Authorized Distributors are data vendors or information providers who have entered into distribution agreements with CGS to distribute or otherwise make available CGS Data to enduser customers. A license agreement with CGS is also required when an enduser's database that contains CUSIP Data is updated, maintained andor operated by an Authorized Distributor, regardless of whether such enduser's database is located internally at the enduser's site or maintained andor updated on the enduser's behalf at the Authorized Distributors' site or other thirdparty site. How are license fees calculated CGS charges fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory license fees for providing the convenience and functionality of access to information originating from an accurate, uptodate and dynamic commercial database compiled and maintained by CGS. License fees are based upon an enduser customer's own particular access to and usage of the CGS Data. Enduser Customers are asked to complete a Use of Service Statement that allows CGS to determine the appropriate fees for that enduser customer. CGS's Use of Service Statement helps achieve the objective of ensuring that enduser customers are treated in a fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory fashion and that license fees are always directly associated with access to and usage of CGS Data. Please explain CGSs basic licensing structure. Like other suppliers of financial information, CGS distributes information from its various commercial databases directly to enduser customers, as well as indirectly through Authorized Distributors. While many of CGS's enduser customers elect to receive access to CGS's Data directly from CGS via a specific CGS database product, other enduser customers elect to receive CGS Data through one or more Authorized Distributors. Both methods of distribution provide a high degree of functionality and convenience to enduser customers, and allow enduser customers to choose their preferred method of delivery. CGS's enduser customers fall into two basic categories. The first group of enduser customers subscribe to a particular CGS commercial database service directly from CGS (a ""direct customer""). The second group of enduser customers elects to receive CGS Data through one or more Authorized Distributors (""indirect customers""). CGS provides Authorized Distributors with the right to incorporate CGS Data and make such CGS Data available to their own customers as part of such Authorized Distributors own products. Both direct and indirect enduser customers must enter into a license agreement with CGS that establishes the appropriate license fees (if any) and terms of use for that enduser customer's access to and usage of CGS Data. CGS's license fees are based upon that enduser customer's own particular access to and usage of the CGS Data. Why isnt CGS Data available for free from CGS or its Authorized Distributors CGS has made, and continues to make, significant investments in developing and updating its commercial databases and delivering its proprietary data in formats and frequencies valued in the marketplace. CGS Data contains data selected and arranged by CGS through the application of methods and standards of judgment used and developed through the expenditure of considerable work, time and money. License fees cover the expense of maintaining the CGS Data and provide incentives to innovate and upgrade the data products that CGS offers. The value of CGS Data is not only the CUSIP identifier itself but also the linked descriptive data that enables the financial marketplace to uniquely identify a particular security. Endusers customers can therefore rely on the provenance of data originating from CGS, which helps them run their operations with reliability. The American Bankers Association is the owner of all intellectual property rights to the CUSIP system, including all intellectual property rights in and to CGS's various commercial databases. Are all endusers of CGS data required to enter into a license agreement with CGS and pay a fee to CGS CGS requires a license agreement with the enduser only when such enduser obtains access to CGS identifiers and related descriptive data either (a) directly from CGS via a particular CUSIP product or service, or (b) indirectly from an Authorized Distributor in downloadable, machine readable or similar bulk format. End users who obtain displayonly access to CGS Data by virtue of an Authorized Distributor's online screen display either through a terminal or website (as distinguished from receipt of the CGS Data from the Authorized Distributor in downloadable, bulk or machine readable format), do not have to enter into a license agreement with CGS or pay any license fees to CGS. Additionally, CGS waives the license fees for an enduser customer who receives access to CGS Data from an Authorized Distributor in machine readable or downloadable format (e.g., a datafeed or other bulk delivery method) but maintains fewer than 500 securities containing CGS Data in its internal database. Can firms take CGS Data from public sources and create their own database without signing a license agreement with CGS CGS Data is publicly available in some offering documents and from other sources. Firms can elect to collect this information and store it in their internal databases for noncommercial use, provided that the source of such information permitted the reproduction and use of such information. However, CGS's experience has been that the CGS data generally has not come from publicly available sources but rather from other sources such as a CGS Authorized Distributor or through improperly scraping websites of CGS customers with valid CGS licenses. Most enduser customers of CGS Data prefer to enter into a license agreement with CGS for authorized use and to enjoy the benefits of the integrity and functionality of downloadable, timely and accurate data (either from CGS directly or from an Authorized Distributor). How does a license agreement work when an enduser customer receives CGS data from several Authorized Distributors It is important to note that the enduser customer only pays CGS once as it only needs one license agreement with CGS. Once a firm has signed a license agreement with CGS for access to and usage of certain CGS Data, they can obtain such CGS Data through multiple Authorized Distributors at no additional charge and without entering into another license agreement with CGS. This is an efficient and fair distribution model as the enduser customer only pays once for access to and use of the CGS Data. Why do both Authorized Distributors and indirect Enduser customers have to pay license fees to CGS CGS charges license fees to indirect enduser customers based upon that enduser's own particular access to and usage of CGS Data as described in its Use of Service Statement. This is to be distinguished from the usage of the CGS Data by Authorized Distributors. CGS's license fees applicable to Authorized Distributors cover the Authorized Distributor's right to (a) access and use CGS's commercial databases for internal purposes, (b) incorporate the CGS dData in their own databases and their own services, and (c) distribute the CGS Data as part of an Authorized Distributor's own services to their own customers. Therefore, the Authorized Distributor is not charged for the enduser's particular access to and usage of the CGS Data. CGS does not charge both Authorized Distributors and indirect enduser Customers for the same service. If the Authorized Distributor makes CGS Data available in readonly access (computer or website display) to its own customer, the fees paid by the Authorized Distributor to CGS may factor in that access, but the enduser customer is not charged separately by CGS. On the other hand, if the enduser customer is obtaining a download or datafeed of CGS Data from the Authorized Distributor (which acts as a substitute for CGS's direct datafeed products), then the enduser customer is charged a license fee by CGS, but the Authorized Distributor is not so charged for this particular use. Thus, indirect enduser customers and Authorized Distributors derive separate benefit from their access to and usage of CGS Data and CGS charges them according to such access and usage.

This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareto make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packagestypically librariesof the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a twostep method (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute andor modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into nonfree programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the ""Lesser"" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing nonfree programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a defacto standard. To achieve this, nonfree programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used nonfree libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in nonfree programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in nonfree programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNULinux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a ""work based on the library"" and a ""work that uses the library"". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called ""this License""). Each licensee is addressed as ""you"". A ""library"" means a collection of software functions andor data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The ""Library"", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the Library"" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications andor translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ""modification"".) ""Source code"" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions The modified work must itself be a software library. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely welldefined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any applicationsupplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a ""work that uses the Library"". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a ""work that uses the library"". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a ""work that uses the Library"" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a ""work that uses the Library"" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machinereadable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machinereadable ""work that uses the Library"", as object code andor source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interfacecompatible with the version that the work was made with. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the ""work that uses the Library"" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library sidebyside in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royaltyfree redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the authordonor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. If the distribution andor use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised andor new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ANDOR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY ANDOR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets """" replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include the brackets) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same ""printed page"" as the copyright notice for easier identification within thirdparty archives. Copyright yyyy name of copyright owner Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at httpwww.apache.orglicensesLICENSE2.0 Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under the License is distributed on an ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. Software Components subject to the Common Public License v 1.0 JUnit Common Public License v 1.0 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS ""Contribution"" means in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and in the case of each subsequent Contributor changes to the Program, and additions to the Program; where such changes andor additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. ""Contributor"" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. ""Licensed Patents"" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. ""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. ""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a nonexclusive, worldwide, royaltyfree copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a nonexclusive, worldwide, royaltyfree patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and its license agreement effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and noninfringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form it must be made available under this Agreement; and a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a crossclaim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a crossclaim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

Choice of Law and Forum This Agreement and the relationship between you and Flurry shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of laws principles. Subject to the arbitration provisions below, you and Flurry hereby agree to submit exclusively, to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts with jurisdiction over San Francisco, California andor the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Binding Arbitration Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a ""written agreement to arbitrate"" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Flurry agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the ""writing"" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. You or Flurry may elect to have any controversy, allegation or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Analytics Service or the User Data, including but not limited to claims for indemnification, contribution, or crossclaims in a pending action involving one or more third parties (collectively, a ""Dispute"") finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. If an inperson arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in San Francisco, California; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the ""metropolitan statistical area"" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Flurry shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. You and Flurry will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Flurry to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Flurry will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASSACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALLENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR FLURRY WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR FLURRY MUST COMMENCE IT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. In the event either you or Flurry elects arbitration, for any Dispute where the total amount of the award sought is less than 10,000 USD, the party requesting relief may further elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding nonappearancebased arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (""ADR"") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online andor be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Entire Agreement This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Flurry and governs your use of the Analytics Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Flurry with respect to the Analytics Service. Survival The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement that by their sense and context are intended to survive the performance hereof by the Parties hereunder, including but not limited to the provisions relating to Indemnity, Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability, shall so survive the completion of the performance, cancellation or termination of this Agreement. version Flurry.Analytics.TOS.v3 last updated April 30, 2012 Software Components subject to Google Open Source License Terms reCAPTCHA Google Open Source License Terms applicable to reCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA Terms of Service By using this API, you consent to be bound by these terms in addition to the Google APIs Terms of Service (""API ToS"") at httpdevelopers.google.comterms.

Content Content Accessible Through our APIs Our APIs contain some third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content.

By accessing users' data through the APIs for use in any of your services or applications, you agree to enable your users of any such service or application to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from Google products and services, subject to applicable laws.

Google may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API. Surviving Provisions When these terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to Sections 8, 9, and 10. 9. Liability for our APIs Warranties Neither Google nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the APIs. For example, we don't make any commitments about the quality of the APIs or the content accessed through the APIs, their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. The APIs and content accessed through the APIs are provided ""as is"". Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of the merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all implied warranties. Limitation of Liability When permitted by law, Google, and Google's suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Google, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claim under these terms, including for any warranties that may not legally be excluded, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the APIs (or, if we choose, to supplying you the APIs again) during the six months prior to the event giving rise to the liability. Nothing in these terms limits your responsibility for infringement of intellectual property rights. In all cases, Google, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable. Indemnification You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Google, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees, or partners, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to your misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs; or your violation or your end user's violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Google will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action. 10. General Provisions Modification We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to an API occasionally, for example, to reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms or the additional terms within the documentation of each applicable API. Changes are effective seven (7) days after they are posted. However, changes specific to new functionality for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. You agree that your continued use of the API constitutes an acceptance of the modified terms. General Legal Terms These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

"Overreaching Provisions in Software License Agreements Overreaching Provisions in Software License Agreements by Michael Liberman April 10, 1995 Cite As Michael Liberman, Comment, Overreaching Provisions in Software License Agreements , 1 R ICH. J.L. T ECH. 4 (1995) . I. Introduction 1 Historically, software license agreements emerged as the most popular means of protection of proprietary rights in computer software. As a common form of contract and trade secret protection, software licenses coexist with other forms of intellectual property rights such as patent and copyright. The importance of these forms of protection has recently increased. Where the licensor fails to consider the implications of the relation between these forms of protection, the licensor's attempts to maximize contractual protection while restricting the licensee's activities regarding the licensed software may result in overreaching. Under these circumstances, a court may invalidate the license agreement in whole or in part. 2 Software license agreements serve several functions in transactions involving the transfer of computer technology. One of the most important legal functions is protection of the proprietary rights of the licensor in the transferred software. Other functions include controlling the revenue streams generated by licensed software and determining the rights and responsibilities of the parties regarding the performance of the licensed technology. Issues related to these functions encompass the applicability of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, including offer and disclaimer of warranties, determining the appropriate types of licenses to utilize, such as single userCPU licenses, siteenterprise licenses, and networkconcurrent licenses. 1 3 Although these issues are important, they are beyond the scope of this paper. The paper focuses primarily on the contractual protection of the intellectual property rights of the licensor, limitations on such protection imposed by federal copyright law and instances where the license agreement may be unenforceable due to overreaching. Since there is no black letter legal definition of what constitutes overreaching, this paper defines overreaching as defeating oneself ""by going too far or by doing or trying to gain too much."" 2 4 Section II explores the role and functions of the software license agreement in the context of the interrelations between patent, copyright, trade secret and contract law. 5 Section III discusses instances of overreaching and the leading court decisions invalidating software license agreements. 6 Section IV analyzes the rationale of the court decisions, their practical implications, and ways of avoiding overreaching provisions in contractual arrangements. 3 II. Applicability of Different Branches of Law to Software License Agreements 7 Proprietary rights in computer software can be protected by copyright, patent, trade secret and contract law. Originally, the two most common means of software protection were those available under contract law and trade secret law. Later, copyright law became another prominent form of protection. Only recently has patent protection for computer software become practically available. 8 Trade secret, copyright and patent law are ""static"" forms of protection in the sense that they may exist independently of any underlying business transactions and do not necessarily require any transfer of intellectual property from one party to another. In contrast, the need for a license agreement usually arises as one of the contractual forms of protection when the underlying business transaction involves the transfer of intellectual property, such as computer software. In this sense, a software license agreement is a ""dynamic"" form of intellectual property protection. 9 Transactions involving the transfer of computer software are subject to both federal and state laws. Generally, state law governs contractual and trade secret aspects of the transaction, while federal law governs aspects related to patent, copyright and antitrust issues. 4 10 The United States Supreme Court has addressed the interrelation between federal and state law numerous times. 5 The Supreme Court has consistently held that state laws must yield when they directly or indirectly afford protection that clashes with the objectives of federal patent or copyright law. 6 As the Court stated in Sears, Roebuck Co. v. Stiffel Co. , when state law touches upon the area of patent or copyright statutes, the benefits of the federal policy may not be denied by state law. 7 11 The objectives of both patent and copyright laws are based on the power of the Congress ""to Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" 8 12 A patent gives an inventor ""the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention throughout the United States."" 9 In order to qualify as a patentable invention, the ""process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or . improvement thereof"" 10 must meet rigorous requirements of novelty, utility and nonobviousness, codified in sections 101, 102 and 103 of the Patent Act. 11 Because of the historical difficulty of defining computer software as patentable subject matter, patents were used less often than copyright for the protection of software. However, this has recently changed. 13 Copyright law applies to ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression"" 12 and ""in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work."" 13 Therefore, copyright protects the expression of an idea but not the idea itself. Copyright protection begins from the moment the work is fixed in a tangible form. According to the Copyright Act, federal copyright law preempts all other ""legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright . . . and that come within the subject matter of copyright . . . . "" 14 14 There is no dispute that computer software is subject matter that can be protected under copyright law. After the 1980 amendment, the Copyright Act contains language specifically covering both literal and nonliteral elements of computer software. 15 Literal elements include both source and object code. 16 Nonliteral elements include user interface and the structure (architecture) of the program. Although courts may differ as to the rationale and sequence of logical steps necessary to extract layers and components of a program structure that can be protected, 17 the general rule is that nonliteral elements of the program can be protected by copyright. 15 Among the exclusive rights that copyright law grants to a copyright owner are the rights to perform or authorize copying, modifying (preparing derivative works), displaying and distributing of copies of the program. 18 Therefore, if the literal and nonliteral elements of computer software can be protected under federal copyright law, the licensor assumes a certain risk that the contractual protection relied upon may be ineffective because of federal law preemption. 16 As a form of contractual protection, a license agreement may serve several functions. It may establish the necessary relationships between the parties to effectuate other forms of protection, for example, trade secret protection. It may also provide some additional means of protection under state common law where either federal or state statutory protection is unavailable. 17 The Uniform Trade Secrets Act codifies the common law of trade secrets 19 and has been adopted in some form by a majority of states. 20 ""Trade secret"" means information, including . a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. 21 18 The factors to be considered in deciding whether information constitutes a trade secret are set forth in the Restatement of Torts (1) the extent to which the information is known outside of the business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken by the owner of the business to guard the secrecy of information; (4) the value of the information to the owner of the business and to his competitors; (5) the amount of efforts expended by the owner of the business in developing the information; and (6) the amount of efforts which should be expended in order to properly acquire or duplicate the information by others. 22 19 Unlike a patented invention, which is disclosed to the public, the innovation or software to be protected as a trade secret should be reasonably kept in secret from the public. Another distinction is that ""unlike the standard applicable to an applicant for a patent, the trade secret proponent is not required to prove its claim nationwide."" 23 A license agreement may be a part of reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy of the information and an essential part of securing trade secret protection. The license agreement can accomplish this by contractually establishing confidential relations between the parties and restricting the dissemination and use of the information outside of the business of the information owner. 20 Where necessary elements of trade secret protection are lacking, a license agreement may create rights and obligations between the parties which are intended to protect, by contract, the intellectual property rights of the licensor. 24 For example, although the standard of novelty for a trade secret is substantially lower than for a patent, there is still a requirement that trade secret information possess at least a minimal degree of novelty. 25 Where the software at issue is lacking a necessary degree of novelty, courts have denied trade secret protection. 26 However, even under such circumstances a license agreement may protect licensed software as valuable knowhow. A program may be valuable merely because it already exists and performs some useful function, and the party who acquires the right to use such a program saves considerable expense on development. In this situation contractual common law protection created by a license agreement may be the only protection available for the licensor, and therefore the only legal means to support the underlying business transaction. 21 Another benefit of contractual protection in the form of license agreements is the ability to strengthen the licensor's position in asserting rights under other forms of intellectual property protection. For example, including notification of the licensor's copyright in a license agreement may make it easier for the licensor (in case of infringement by the licensee) to recover either damages for the infringement, 27 or an award of statutory damages. As for trade secrets, license agreement provisions for confidentiality, reasonable noncompetition and reasonable restriction on the use and distribution of licensed software may facilitate the licensor's ability to prevent competitors from obtaining licensed programs. This ability is not automatically provided by trade secret law. 22 A license agreement, as opposed to a sale, allows the licensor to retain the title to the software which goes into possession of the licensee under the agreement. This is essential for establishing contractual obligations facilitating both trade secret and copyright protection of the licensor. 23 After enactment of the Computer Software Rental Amendments Act in 1990 28 federal copyright law prohibits licensees and purchasers from leasing the computer programs without permission of the copyright owner. 29 There are still significant differences in the rights of purchasers and licensees. Perhaps the most significant of these differences is based on the first sale doctrine, under which a purchaser (as opposed to a licensee) of a copyrighted item has the right to sell that copy or dispose of it in any way without the permission of a copyright owner. 30 By contracting for a license agreement as opposed to a sale, the owner of the intellectual property retains the right to exercise control over further disposition of the software. The licensor can also attempt to contractually restrict certain activities regarding the licensed software. 24 There are certain limitations on what can be accomplished by contractual means where issues of public policy are involved, 31 especially relating to restraints on competition. 32 ""The common law courts would require a substantial demonstration of the need for a restraint. Courts value highly the right to compete free from contractual restraint and have permitted restraints no broader than those required by the justification."" 33 25 Another limitation may be imposed by the relevant state statute ""a contract cannot be used to go beyond the limits of the statutory right. Under our law, as it has developed, the statutes provide the limits to contract."" 34 ""This tradition suggests that courts should not expand the scope of intellectual property rights simply because owners assert such rights and claim a loss of value if the rights are not recognized."" 35 Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software confirmed the theory that in addition to private contractual arrangements, state statutes are without power to extend the licensor's protection beyond the limits of the statutory rights established by federal law. 36 III. Leading Court Decisions Invalidating Software License Agreements 26 Adequate employment of software license provisions gives the licensor an opportunity to effectively protect its intellectual property rights in licensed software. However, in some instances the licensor is overzealous in asserting its rights and stretching them beyond the scope of state trade secret and contract protection, ""trespassing"" into the area of federal copyright or patent law. Ordinarily this occurs when the licensor tries to use as much protective language as possible without proper analysis of the licensed software and the interrelation of state and federal law. According to one commentator, once lawyers persuaded software developers that they could not sell their programs like books and instead had to demand that their customers sign onerous license agreements as a condition to access to the software, the floodgates were opened for lawyers to pile into the agreements all protection they could think of for their clients. 37 In such cases, the licensor may be exposed to the alleged infringer's challenge, based generally on the grounds of federal copyright law preemption. The court decisions discussed in this section demonstrate that such a challenge may be successful even where the licensee in fact breaches the license agreement or infringes the copyright. It has been noted that ""in the area of activity restrictions . . . the courts and legislatures have been somewhat active, both in setting aside restrictions they perceive as overreaching, and in providing new law to deal with legitimate concerns that vendors have had to address through their licenses."" 38 27 The facts in two of the discussed cases Sega Enterprises v. Accolade, Inc. 39 and Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America 40 do not directly involve software licenses. In these cases, both defendants purchased and reverseengineered software products without the permission of the developer and copyright owner. However, these decisions are discussed here because the prohibition on copying and reverse engineering of the software is a common provision for software licenses where the software is licensed in the form of object code. The rationale of the court decisions in Sega and Atari is applicable to software license disputes and can serve as a guideline for the drafter of a license agreement attempting to avoid overreaching. 28 Other decisions discussed in this section deal with software license agreements of different types, ranging from the boxtop (or shrinkwrap) 41 licenses in Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software 42 to customized software in Lasercomb America v. Reynolds. 43 29 In Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software , the plaintiff developed a program to protect a certain type of magnetic disk from unauthorized copying. The defendant copied plaintiff's program, analyzed how it worked and based on this analysis, developed its own program. The main purpose of this program was to defeat Vault's protection scheme. In addition, the second version of Quaid's software contained approximately thirty characters copied from Vault's program. The shrinkwrap license agreement accompanying Vault's software specifically prohibited the licensee from transferring, sublicensing, renting, leasing, conveying, copying, modifying, translating, converting to another programming language, decompiling or disassembling 44 the licensed software for any purpose without the licensor's prior written consent. 45 30 Vault brought an action seeking an injunction and monetary damages. The plaintiff asserted that Quaid committed copyright infringement by (1) copying Vault's program for the purpose of developing a program designed to defeat the function of Vault's program, and (2) copying approximately thirty characters of Vault's program into Quaid's program, which Vault contended constituted a derivative work. 46 31 Vault also asserted two claims based on state law. First, it contended that Quaid breached the license agreement by decompiling and disassembling Vault's program in violation of the Louisiana Software License Enforcement Act 47 (""Louisiana's License Act""). Second,Vault claimed that Quaid misappropriated Vault's program in violation of the Louisiana Uniform Trade Secrets Act 48 (this latter claim was abandoned by Vault on appeal). 32 The Fifth Circuit relied on the Copyright Act, which specifically states that it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program when such new copy or adaptation (1) . is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner, or (2) . is for archival purposes only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful. 49 33 The court refused to follow Vault's interpretation of 117 under which an exception of 117(1) would permit the copying of a computer program only for the purpose of using it as intended by the copyright owner. Therefore, the court decided that ""Quaid did not infringe Vault's exclusive right to reproduce its program in copies under 106(1)."" 50 34 The court then addressed the issue of the derivative work. The Copyright Act provides that the copyright owner has an exclusive right to prepare derivative works of the copyrighted source material. 51 An infringing derivative work must contain in some form a portion of the copyrighted work and both works must be substantially similar. 52 In the case at bar, eighty pages of Quaid's work contained thirty characters from Vault's program. Vault contended that this sequence of characters was essential to the operation of its program and was also crucial to the ability of Quaid's software to defeat the protective function of Vault's program; therefore, as Vault argued, the copying was qualitatively significant. 53 Vault relied heavily on the Whelan Associates decision, which states that a ""court must make a qualitative, not quantitative, judgment about the character of the work as a whole and the importance of the substantially similar portions of the work."" 54 35 The Vault court distinguished Whelan Assocs. based on the fact that in Whelan Assocs. the derivative work performed essentially the same function as the copyrighted work, whereas in Vault , Quaid's and Vault's programs served opposing functions, and were not substantially similar. Therefore, the court concluded that Quaid's program did not constitute a derivative work of Vault's program. 55 36 Addressing Vault's claims under Louisiana state law, the court stated that Louisiana's License Act permitted the inclusion of such terms as the prohibition of (1) any copying of the program for any purpose, and (2) modifying andor adapting the program in any way, including adaptation by reverseengineering, decompilation or disassembly in the license agreement. 56 The Fifth Circuit agreed with the district court that there were numerous conflicts between the Louisiana License Act and the Copyright Act. 57 The district court held that Vault's shrinkwrap license agreement was a contract of adhesion and as such it could be enforceable only if the Louisiana License Act was valid and enforceable itself. 58 Citing the Supreme Court's decision in Sears, Roebuck , the Fifth Circuit court decided that Louisiana's License Act clearly touched upon an area of federal copyright law and was therefore preempted by federal law. 59 The court concluded that the provision in Vault's license agreement, which prohibited the decompilation or disassembly of its program, was unenforceable under federal law. 60 37 In Lasercomb America v. Reynolds , 61 plaintiff developed a diemaking software program called Interact and licensed the object code to Holiday Steel Rule Company (""Holiday""). The license agreement contained noncompete provisions which prohibited a licensee from writing, developing, producing or selling such software during the term of the license agreement (ninetynine years in that particular case). 62 The licensee was further prohibited from writing, developing, producing or selling or assisting others in the writing, developing, producing or selling computer assisted die making software (for the term of the license agreement and for one year after its termination), directly or indirectly, without Lasercomb's prior written consent. 63 Nevertheless, Holiday copied the program in violation of the license terms, and its programmer, Reynolds, reverse engineered and then slightly modified Lasercomb's program. 64 Holiday then sold it as a Holiday software product, PDS100. Reynolds developed a function that encrypted the Holiday program's output in order to hide the origin of the program from the customers. 38 Lasercomb brought an action for copyright infringement, breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation of trade secret, unfair competition and false designation of origin. 65 The district court found for the plaintiff on all counts. 66 One of the defendant's contentions on appeal was that it was error for the district court to reject their copyright misuse defense. 67 39 On appeal, the Fourth Circuit decided that the noncompete clause of the license agreement was anticompetitive and contrary to public policy. 68 The court upheld the defendant's copyright misuse defense and held that the plaintiff's copyright, as well as the license agreement, were unenforceable. 69 40 The court stated that ""the question is not whether the copyright is being used in a manner violative of antitrust law (such as whether the licensing agreement is 'reasonable'), but whether the copyright is being used in a manner violative of the public policy embodied in the grant of a copyright."" 70 Although the defendants did not sign the license, they were able to prove that at least one other licensee had signed Lasercomb's standard license agreement which contained an anticompetitive clause. This was sufficient for the court to find that copyright misuse was a valid defense for the defendant. The only count on which the court held for the plaintiff was fraud. 71 41 In Sega Enterprises v. Accolade, Inc. , 72 the plaintiff, a Japanese company, brought an action for trademark and copyright infringement and unfair competition. Sega manufactured the Genesis console which was used to play video games. The object code which manipulated the console was stored in readonly memory (ROM) which was commercially available. The defendant, an American company in the business of developing computer software, reverse engineered Sega's program from the object code, analyzed it and developed its own software for Sega's console using the information acquired by reverse engineering. 73 42 The Ninth Circuit held that the reverseengineering performed by Accolade satisfied the requirements of fair use. 74 In reaching this decision, the court applied the four factor test for a fair use defense under copyright law (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work. 75 43 As for the first factor, the direct purpose of Accolade's copying was to study Sega's program in order to be able to provide the compatibility with Sega's console 76 (although the ultimate goal was to develop its own software for Genesis). In the court's view, this was enough for Accolade to be able to assert a fair use defense. 77 44 Analyzing the second factor, the court examined the ideaexpression dichotomy. Copyright law protects an expression of an idea, but not the idea itself. 78 Therefore, in the court's view, copyright law does not protect functional elements of computer programs necessary for the operation of a program, because they are not part of a protected expression. 79 Otherwise, a copyright owner would obtain patentlike protection without meeting the rigorous requirements for patentability. The court decided that Sega's software could be afforded a lesser degree of protection than more traditional literary works because it contained unprotected aspects that could not be analyzed without copying. 80 45 With regard to the third factor, the court found that Accolade had copied the entire program. 81 This factor favored the plaintiff. However, the court concluded that the ultimate use of the copied program was insubstantial and therefore the third factor was of little weight. 82 46 As to the fourth factor, the court held in favor of the defendant. The court concluded that the effect of Accolade's activity upon the potential market was not negative because it would increase the number of programs offered for Genesis consumers. 83 The court found that there was no reason to assume that there would be substantial harm to the market for Sega's products. 84 Even if there were some insignificant harm to Sega's market, in the court's view that was not a sufficient reason for denying Accolade's fair use defense. 85 47 The court concluded, therefore, that three of the four factors were in the defendant's favor and that Accolade's copying and reverseengineering were protected by the fair use defense. In the court's view, reverseengineering (along with the copying of the original program) is permitted under copyright law where there are no other ways to gain access to the program and understand functional concepts in order to develop compatible products. 86 48 In Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America , 87 Atari reverseengineered a computer program developed by Nintendo to prevent the use of unauthorized cartridges on the Nintendo Entertainment System. 88 In order to obtain sufficient information about Nintendo's system, Atari's former counsel obtained source code for the security program developed by Nintendo from the United States Copyright Office under false pretenses. This code was later used in the process of reverse engineering. 89 49 Nintendo alleged that Atari had infringed on its copyright by copying the source code of the program obtained from the Copyright Office, copying the program during the reverse engineering process, and creating programs substantially similar to Nintendo's program. Nintendo moved for a preliminary injunction which was granted by the district court. 90 50 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) upheld the injunction but disagreed with the district court's rationale as to the issue of reverse engineering. 91 The CAFC held that reverse engineering itself, untainted by the purloined copy of Nintendo's program, was a fair use because it was the only way to examine the object code on Nintendo's chip. 92 The court stated that intermediate copying can be justified as a fair use when it is required by the nature of the work in order to understand the ideas and processes in a copyrighted work. 93 However, the CAFC concluded that, because of its use of a misappropriated copy of Nintendo's source code, Atari should be denied protection under the fair use defense. 94 IV. Analysis of Court Decisions 51 There is no clearcut rule that proscribes a way to avoid overreaching. However, an analysis of leading court decisions will provide some understanding of the grounds on which software license provisions may be invalidated. A. Lessons to Learn 52 1. State trade secret and contract law are preempted by federal copyright law. This is perhaps the most important premise for the court decisions that affect the resolution of all other issues relevant to software license disputes. Whether the legal or equitable right asserted or prohibited by the license agreement in question is equal to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of federal copyright law is key to deciding the question of the validity of the license agreement. 53 To resolve this issue, the courts appear to differ in the application of the ""equivalence of rights"" test. The Vault 95 court, in invalidating the license agreement and Louisiana's License Act, found that the provisions of state law clearly conflicted with federal law but did not directly address the ""additional element"" test. In Foresight Resources Corp. v. Pfortmiller , 96 the fifth circuit reached a similar decision, emphasizing that the plaintiff's claim was based ""precisely upon the same facts as those underlying plaintiff's copyright infringement claims."" 97 The court in Computer Assocs. v. Altai 98 held that state law is not preempted where the state claim contains additional elements (for example, a breach of a confidential relationship) which change the nature of the cause of action. In other words, under the ""additional element"" test, if the elements of the plaintiff's claim under state law are exactly the same as the elements of the claim under federal law, state law is preempted. 99 54 As the court decisions suggest, in order to successfully challenge the validity of a license agreement, the licensee may rely on the doctrine of federal law preemption in at least three different ways. 55 Under the first rationale, if state law affords the licensee fewer rights in the licensed program than federal copyright law, the license may be held unenforceable. 100 The second option for the licensee is to raise an equitable defense of copyright misuse. 101 The third option is to assert a fair use defense under federal copyright law. 102 56 2. Unreasonable, anticompetitive noncompete clauses may be used by the infringing licensee as an equitable copyright misuse defense. 103 The whole license may be held unenforceable even where the infringing acts are totally unrelated to the noncompete clause itself. 104 The obvious lesson is to draft noncompetition provisions more carefully and to avoid anticompetitive language in the license of the copyrighted work. In addition to using a severability clause, the benefits that a particular provision can give must be carefully balanced against the dangerous possibility that if anticompetitive, the whole license agreement becomes invalid. 57 3. The enforceability of boxtop (shrinkwrap) licenses is highly questionable. The Vault court unequivocally treated a license of such type as a contract of adhesion and, therefore, unenforceable. 105 Although a more recent decision in StepSaver Data Systems v. Wyse Technology 106 does not directly address the issue of overreaching, it provides an important insight into the rationale that may be applied to the cases of overreaching. Addressing the disclaimer of warranties made in the boxtop license, the StepSaver court stated that where the disclaimers are made available to the potential licensee only after the contract is formed, section 2207 of the U.C.C., and not the license itself, governs the interpretation of the agreement. 107 Therefore, in the absence of an affirmative act on the part of a prospective licensee indicating that he or she was aware of the terms of the boxtop license agreement (for example, where a customer in the computer store fails to read a boxtop license and the licensor attempts to enforce such a license), there is a significant probability that the court would find overreaching and hold the license agreement unenforceable in part or in whole. 58 4. Courts have held that reverse engineering and disassembly constitute fair use under certain circumstances. As the court held in Sega , ""we conclude that where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law."" 108 Although the Sega and Atari courts did not deal with this issue in the context of a license agreement, this rationale can be applicable to software license disputes based on the federal law preemption doctrine. A similar rationale was employed by the Vault court in invalidating a software license under Louisiana state law. 109 59 5. When applying the fair use defense to the copying and reverse engineering of the software products, courts do not necessarily engage in the analysis aimed at the precise separation of the protected and unprotected elements of the programs (similar to the approaches of the Lotus , 110 Computer Assocs. 111 or Gates Rubber 112 courts) in order to allow copying and reverseengineering only for the unprotected elements of the program (ideas and facts) and disallow it as for the protected elements (expressions of the ideas). The courts do not reason that the fair use defense may be applicable only to the protected elements of the program because the doctrine of fair use itself is aimed at the justification in some instances of using the protected elements in a manner which, without the fair use defense, would constitute infringement. Instead, it was enough for the Sega court to find that allegedly infringing programs contained some unprotected elements under copyright law in order to reject plaintiffs' claims for unpermitted copying and reverse engineering of the whole program. 60 6. Judicial interpretation of 117 of the Copyright Act, as evidenced by the Vault opinion, does not allow the licensor to control the manner in which the program may be lawfully used for the purposes of 117(1)'s exception to the Copyright Act. 113 61 7. Even where the court is required to make a qualitative judgment about the importance of the part of the program copied by an alleged infringer, the court has the discretion to determine its own criteria for making such a judgment. Where policy considerations are involved which favor promoting competition on the market, the plaintiff's argument that the copied part of the program constitutes the main value of the program and is crucial for its functioning, as well as the functioning of the allegedly infringing program, may be rejected, as it was rejected by the Vault court. 114 B. How to Avoid Overreaching 62 There are a number of tools of contractual protection available to the parties to a license agreement. 115 A license agreement ordinarily contains a provision where the parties acknowledge the status of the licensed program and licensed documentation as confidentialproprietary information. Confidentialproprietary information (subject to some additional requirements) is information disclosed to the licensee by the licensor or some other authorized party. In addition to the confidential information commonly used in other types of trade secretknowhow license agreements, software license agreements allow the licensor to designate research programs, computer software, program files, source, object and executable codes as confidential. 63 The Model Software License Provisions offer a number of clauses which may be used for the protection of the licensor's proprietary rights and restriction of certain licensee's activities. These clauses determine (a) security conditions, 116 (b) nonuse obligations, 117 (c) nondisclosure obligations, 118 (d) restrictions on unauthorized copying, 119 (e) disclosure procedures ordered by governmental bodies, 120 (f) requirements of no removal of proprietary legends, 121 (g) requirements of reports of thirdparty misappropriation, 122 and (h) posttermination procedures. 123 64 If the licensor wants to minimize the probability of overreaching while restricting the licensee's activity regarding the licensed software, it may consider separating different means of contractual protection. The licensor may then apply only those contractual clauses or devices which are more appropriate to the particular software product or its component (in addition to the means of protection available under federal copyright and patent law). 65 A good starting point may be a detailed and precise definition of the licensed software. The particular provisions depend on the complexity of the software product. In some cases, a satisfactory definition may require reference to a special supplement or appendix, which may also include a detailed description of important software characteristics. 124 66 The licensor may choose to protect the whole software product by taking advantage of the appropriate confidentiality provisions. Such provisions could include, among others, a security conditions clause, a nondisclosure obligation clause and a nonuse obligation clause. 125 67 It may be beneficial for the licensor to apply different means of legal protection to both the software components which provide interface (compatibility) with hardware and other ""external"" software components of the system (the ""ideas and facts"" or ""functional elements"") and those parts of the program which constitute ""the expression of the ideas."" 68 As for the first group, the analysis of the Sega and Atari decisions leads to an argument for the licensor to not cover such software components with the clause restricting unauthorized copying, duplicating, reverse engineering, reverse compiling and disassembling as long as the nondisclosure obligation clause and other relevant clauses adequately protect the licensor's proprietary rights in these components. 69 As for the second group of software components, the use of the clause restricting unauthorized copying, duplicating, reverse engineering, reverse compiling and disassembling may be helpful in supplementing and strengthening copyright and trade secret protection. 126 However, while drafting such provisions, the licensor has to take into consideration the limitations imposed on the licensor's exclusive rights conferred by federal copyright law. Otherwise, a licensor's attempt to prohibit certain uses of the software, 127 or to impose stricter limitations on the licensee's right to make copies or adaptations of the copyrighted program in instances specifically permitted by 117, 128 may result in overreaching. The court decisions in Vault and Lasercomb support these propositions. 129 70 The licensor may also identify crucial components and treat them as separate parts of the licensed software system, specifically prohibiting their copying and reverse engineering. This may help the licensor to avoid a situation similar to that in Vault , where the defendant Quaid copied and used the most important and valuable part of the plaintiff Vault's program. The Vault court did not find infringement on the part of Quaid, notwithstanding Vault's arguments that the copied part was essential to its functioning and that the Whelan Associates decision directed courts to make a qualitative, not a quantitative, judgment about the importance of the copied part. 130 71 The above approach may allow the licensor to adequately protect different functional components of the program with different means of legal protection and to avoid the invalidation of the license agreement because of overreaching. Even if the licensee reverse engineers the software component which is not covered by the clause prohibiting unauthorized copying and reverse engineering, it may not be able to exploit this information under appropriately drafted nonuse obligation and nondisclosure obligation clauses. At the same time, the license agreement itself will not be vulnerable to the licensee's allegations of overreaching. 72 The proposed approach may be illustrated by the following example. Suppose A company develops for B company a communication system consisting of hardware and software components. Hardware is delivered under the contract of sale, and software is licensed out from A to B. 73 The licensee, B, develops its own application programs which run on different computers connected to the network. In order to interact with each other and to exchange the application data necessary for their work, the application programs use the licensed communication software. Logically these application programs are placed on top of the underlying licensed communication software, which in turn is placed on top of the underlying hardware and communication devices. 74 The communication software consists of different parts. These parts may be viewed as several layers, functioning on different logical levels, where programs at each level are responsible for the realization of the functions designated to that particular level only. The programs interact with their counterparts on different computers. In order to communicate with each other, different programs at the same level of hierarchy follow special rules of interaction, which are called protocols. The programs of any level may also interact with other software (or, in case of the lowest level hardware) components residing at the adjacent levels of the vertical hierarchy. The rules governing such interactions are called interfaces. 75 Application data, which is being transmitted from an application program working on one computer to an application program working on another, is delivered from the highest logical level of software system to the lowest, being processed respectively by the programs of each logical level. Eventually this data is delivered from the programs of the lowest logical level to the hardware components of the system and transmitted through the communication devices and communication channels to the destination computer. There the application data makes its way up through all logical levels of software components and is eventually delivered to an application programaddressee. 76 For the typical software system described in this example it is common for the licensor to disclose to the licensee the interface between the programs of the highest logical level and the application programs presumably developed by the licensee. The licensed software is rendered useless to the licensee without this information. However, the interfaces between the program components of different levels (including the interface between the lowestlevel software components and the hardware) and the protocols may be proprietary information of the licensor and thus subject to protection under the license agreement. 77 Licensed software's primary value may be enjoyed in two ways. First, the software components of the lowest level in the logical hierarchy are designed specifically to facilitate the operation of the underlying hardware and communications devices. Thus it is possible for the licensee to acquire the use of the whole system. This information about the interface with the hardware is crucial for writing software intelligently on the lowest level. Otherwise, the whole system hierarchy, including the programs of the higher levels, becomes useless. Thus, the party obtaining such information acquires the principal ability to develop its own software and to use underlying hardware and communication equipment. Such information may be treated as a ""fact,"" ""idea"" or ""functional element."" Access to this information makes it possible to exploit the whole system, including both hardware and software components, without regard to the effectiveness of its particular implementation. Technically, the interface between the software components at the lowest level and hardware may be realized through a program. Where there are only one or few possible ways of interacting through the use of predetermined codes, the ""expression"" of the idea (as implemented in the program) and the ""idea"" itself (the concrete codes, or bit combinations, of the interface) merge into one and may be treated as an ""idea,"" or ""functional element"" (in terms of the Sega court). As such, it is considered unprotected under copyright law. 78 The second aspect relates to the performance characteristics of the whole structure of the software system, including all hierarchy levels. Designing, coding, testing, system tuning, eliminating mistakes and other stages of the software life cycle may be much more expensive than hardware components. The logical structures, algorithms and programming techniques employed for the realization of the software may be the primary asset for the party who desires to develop a whole system. The ready and effective software system provides an advantage for the party who gets access to such a system. Therefore, the main value is based upon the practical realization of the programs as a particular expression of scientific and engineering ideas which underlie the design of the software system. 79 The licensor will most likely seek to protect his intellectual property rights in both aspects of the licensed software in operationsdevelopment facilitation and in performance characteristics. Keeping the information concerning the interface with the hardware secret will prevent unauthorized development of programs which exploit the hardware, the communications equipment and the network. Protecting information about the design, structure and practical implementation of the whole software system will support the licensor's software market position and prevent competitors from gaining an unfair advantage over the licensor. 80 While it may be tempting for the licensor to invoke as much protective language as possible without regard to the function and structure of the software, the possibility of overreaching should be noted. In addition to the security conditions clause, nonuse obligations clause and nondisclosure obligations clause, the licensor may include provisions prohibiting the licensee from copying, duplicating, reverseengineering, reversecompiling and disassembling of any part of the licensed software system. Later, if the licensee copies and reverse engineers the licensed software, including the components implementing interaction with the hardware and communication equipment, the licensor may bring an action for breach of the license agreement. But it may turn out that the employed provisions are ""overinclusive"" and lead to overreaching. 81 Employed provisions may be appropriate for protection of the licensor's rights in the second aspect, i.e. for protection of the design, structure and implementation of the software system. Most likely, these will be considered an expression of the idea and will be afforded federal copyright law protection. 82 However, as for the first aspect, such provisions may lead to overreaching. The prohibition of the copying and reverseengineering is intended to apply to the components of the lowest levels of software hierarchy interacting with the hardware (as well as to all other components). This may effectively protect the ""ideas,"" but not the ""expressions"" of ideas. It may also make it impossible for the licensee to obtain the information necessary to provide compatibility between the software and hardware components. For example, if the licensee decides to develop its own programs to be used on the hardware system which the licensee had already acquired, such protection may not be available for the licensor, according to the Sega and Atari courts. 131 Under the Vault decision, if such restrictive provisions are included in the license agreement and the licensor later brings an action for breach of a license agreement, the court may hold that the restrictive provisions touch upon the area of federal copyright law and constitute overreaching. 83 In addition, the impermissible restriction on copying and reverseengineering of the program components responsible for the compatibility of the software system with the hardware and communication devices may be interpreted as an intentional restriction of competitors' access to the market. This may not only subject the licensor to accusations of antitrust violations, but also may allow the licensee to successfully raise the copyright misuse defense, according to the Lasercomb court. 132 Additionally, this may also lead to an invalidation of the license agreement because of overreaching restrictions on copying and reverseengineering. 84 Under these circumstances, the licensor may argue that federal copyright law preemption should not apply to its claim under state trade secret law or state contract law, which is valid under the ""equivalence of rights"" doctrine. 133 The licensor's argument may be premised upon the contention that its claim includes an extra element a breach of confidentiality provision under the license agreement which is not required for bringing an action for copyright infringement. However, the licensor may face significant difficulties defending such a position. 85 In order to be treated as confidentialproprietary, the information should be disclosed to the licensee by the licensor or by a third party with the licensor's consent. In the case where the licensee attempts to reverseengineer the program, the software system was obviously delivered in object code, which is readable by the computer, but is generally unreadable by humans. The very purpose of reverseengineering is to translate the program from object code into source code, which makes further analysis, adaptation and use of the program possible for the licensee, without having to gain permission from the licensor. The licensee may therefore have a valid argument that software in object code is not confidentialproprietary information because it was not disclosed by the licensor. In fact, the licensee may argue that the very prohibition of the reverse engineering in the license agreement is irreconcilable with the contention that the program was disclosed to the licensee. One does not have to reconstruct information if it is already disclosed, and the reverseengineering constitutes the process of such reconstruction. 86 Therefore, if the software in object code was not disclosed to the licensee by the licensor and is not confidentialproprietary information, then no confidential relationship as to this information was established between the parties. The copying and reverse engineering of the object code does not breach the confidentiality provisions of the license agreement. 87 Hence, the licensor fails to satisfy the ""extra element"" test. Under the ""equivalence of rights"" doctrine, state law is preempted by federal copyright law. Accordingly, the licensor most likely has no valid claim under the described circumstances because the fair use defense probably applies. 88 In order to avoid these types of problems, the licensor has several options. 89 The licensor may decide to separately define the software components of the lowest logical level which interacts with the hardware and communication equipment. Then he may define the rest of the software system. As to the software components of the lowest level, the licensor may choose to use the full range of intellectual property protection provisions, including security, nonuse and nondisclosure clauses, with the exception of activityrestricting provisions that prohibit reverseengineering and equivalent procedures. As to the rest of the software system, the prohibition of reverseengineering in addition to security, nonuse, nondisclosure and other protective provisions may be appropriate. 90 The licensor may also consider providing the source code of the components of the lowest level, or disclosing the information about the interface with the hardware and communication equipment sufficient to enable the licensee to develop his own communication software. This allows the licensor to impose stringent restrictions on the possible use of such information, minimizing the chance of impermissible exploitation. Under these circumstances, the licensee loses justification for copying and reverseengineering the whole system because of the separation of the whole system into two functionally distinct parts. Additionally, confidential relations are established as to the whole system, including the programs of the lowest level. In other words, this strengthens the licensor's position for bringing an action under state trade secret or contract law where the confidential relations are breached by the licensee. Therefore the licensor obtains an additional element for its claim, and avoids preemption of its state law claim by federal copyright law, under the ""equivalence of rights"" doctrine. 91 Another benefit for the licensor in employing such an approach is premised on the fact that it establishes a procompetitive character for the respective noncompete clause. 134 Thus the possibility of the equitable defense of copyright misuse and invalidation of the license agreement on public policy grounds is eliminated. The discussed approach may be selected when there is an insignificant chance of the disclosed information being unlawfully acquired by the licensor's competitors. However, under certain circumstances such an approach may be unacceptable. Where the practical implementation of ""policing"" procedures is too burdensome or expensive and the probability of misappropriation of disclosed confidential information by licensor's competitors is too high, the proposed approach may be impermissibly risky. This is true even if it seems to be viable from a purely legal standpoint. 92 As an alternative approach the licensor may consider the use of a source code escrow package. 135 This package includes a complete copy of the source code and executable code of the licensed program, and a complete copy of design documentation and user documentation. It encompasses complete instructions for compiling and linking each part of the source code into executable code, with precise identifications of the components of the system software necessary to generate executable code from the source code. Such a source code escrow package should be delivered to an escrow agent. Certain events can trigger the release of the source code escrow package from the escrow agent to the licensee temporarily or permanently during the predefined maintenance period. Ordinarily, such events may include (a) insolvency or inability of the licensor to pay its debts as they become due (permanent release); (b) filing by the licensor a petition for protection under the Bankruptcy Code (permanent release); (c) acquiring a business of the licensor by a licensee's competitor (permanent release); or (d) inability or failure of the licensor to cure a breach of certain warranties for a predetermined period of time (in this case, the release is temporary for the period of time necessary to effectuate any reasonable attempt of the licensee to cure the breach). 136 If the licensee obtains the right of access to the source code escrow package from the escrow agent upon the occurrence of one of these predefined events, the licensee must properly document the occurrence of such an event. All the materials and information comprising the source code escrow package should be maintained in strict confidence and may be used or disclosed only in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the license agreement. In case of a temporary release, the licensee must promptly return all released materials to the licensor when the circumstances which caused the release are no longer in effect. It is the licensee's obligation to promptly respond to the licensor's requests concerning the use or contemplated use of the source code escrow package and the information about the licensee's employees having access to the package. 93 Traditionally, one of the main functions of the source code escrow package is to serve as a protective tool for the licensee when the licensor faces bankruptcy or insolvency problems, where the licensor does not fulfill its support or maintenance obligations or where breaches of warranties take place. However, such a package may also be effectively employed by the licensor to avoid overreaching when related to the prohibition on reverseengineering of the program object code. 94 Under the proposed approach, the parties may agree to the additional mutually acceptable predefined circumstances which will enable the licensee to temporarily obtain access to the source code or certain parts of the source code. For example, this would be applicable where the program components interact with hardware, or where the information is sufficient to reconstruct the interface between communication software components and hardware. The licensee's need to obtain the information about the interface with hardware and communication equipment to make certain program modifications with its own resources, or develop its own programs, may be an example of such predetermined events. If the licensee lawfully obtains access to the source code, it must comply with the established procedural and confidentiality requirements under the control of an escrow agent. Furthermore, the licensee has to properly document the occurrence of an appropriate event and must maintain the obtained information in strict confidence. It may be used only in compliance with the nonuse obligation clause, the nondisclosure obligation clause and other relevant clauses of the license agreement. 95 Thus, the licensor will be able to achieve the desired degree of protection without incurring the risk of courtdeclared invalidation of the license agreement due to overreaching. V. Conclusion 96 Overreaching occurs where a license agreement places impermissible restrictions on the licensee's activities relating to the licensed software. Under such circumstances, the license agreement may be invalidated in whole or in part. Common issues where overreaching takes place are prohibitions on reverseengineering coupled with copying of the program, and noncompete clauses which are anticompetitive. 97 Often overreaching occurs where the licensor is trying to contractually obtain patentlike protection for licensed software without meeting the rigorous requirements of patent law. It also occurs where the software sought to be protected contains functional elements unprotected under copyright law, and where reverseengineering is the only method available for the licensee to understand how the licensed software works to achieve compatibility with other components of its computer system. 98 In decisions that hold license agreements unenforceable because of overreaching, courts rely on the doctrine of federal law preemption, the fair use defense under federal copyright law and the equitable defense of copyright misuse. To resolve the issue of federal copyright law preemption, the courts employ the ""equivalence of rights"" doctrine and the ""extra element"" test. Moreover, courts are willing to actively apply public policy considerations aimed at the protection of the market competition from unreasonable restraints and promoting the free flow of useful ideas protected under patent law. 99 To minimize the risk of overreaching, the licensor may perform an analysis aimed at determining which elements of the program are either protected or unprotected under federal copyright law. The licensor should then apply adequate means of contractual protection to the different elements of the program, in addition to careful drafting (using a severability clause) and refraining from anticompetitve provisions. 100 The proposed approach may provide the licensee with a ""viable alternative"" to reverseengineering where the licensee needs access to unprotected elements of the licensed software. In many cases, even though the licensee does not engage in the unauthorized copying or reverseengineering of the licensed software, the licensee may still run the risk of being sued for copyright infringement and breach of license agreement. As a result, in such cases it will eliminate the need for a fair use defense, and it may even make such a defense unavailable. At the same time this allows the licensor to achieve the desired level of protection without facing the risk of the court invalidating the license agreement because of overreaching. Both parties therefore may benefit from the increased certainty and predictability of their relationships under the software license agreements.

Ordinarily, such terms can state that the customer has not acquired title to the software but merely obtained a nontransferable personal license to use the software. For a detailed discussion of boxtop licenses see David A. Einhorn, Boxtop Licenses and the Battleoftheforms , 5 S OFTWARE L.J. 401, 418 (1992). 42 847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir. 1988). 43 911 F.2d 970 (4th Cir. 1990). 44 Using programming languages, computer programmers develop software in the form of source code, which is readable by humans. The software is then translated into the object code, in which the program is represented by the combination of 1s and 0s. Then the software is transformed into the executable code, which can be run on the computer. As a practical matter, in order to understand the program and to intelligently and effectively modify or improve it, programmers need access to the source code. Reverseengineering, decompiling and disassembling are functionally similar procedures of reconstructing the text of the program by converting software from the forms suitable to usage by the computer back into the source code. 45 Vault , 847 F.2d at 257 n.2. 46 Id . at 258. 47 L A .

Eligibility and supervising children We are concerned about the safety and privacy of all users of our Services, particularly children. The United States Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, COPPA) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. With regard to schoolbased activities, COPPA allows schools and school districts to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that students parent, legal guardian, school or school district has provided consent in accordance with COPPA for us to collect and disclose such information. No child under 13 should send us any personal information unless the childs parent, legal guardian, school or school district has provided consent in accordance with COPPA. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information to us if your parent, legal guardian, school or school district has not provided this prior consent, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without consent from his or her parent, legal guardian, school or school district, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at adminblendspace.com . If you are a school or school district, you should obtain advance written consent from all parents or legal guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. When obtaining consent, you should provide parents and legal guardians with these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Childrens Online Privacy Policy. You should keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For additional information on our privacy practices as they relate to children, please visit our Childrens Online Privacy Policy which discusses our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 at COPPA Policy . What this means Children under the age of 13 must have parental consent to use our websites and services and should be supervised when using them.

We accept no responsibility for, and do not guarantee, the accuracy, integrity or quality of any UserUploaded Content.

This could result in data concerning your identity being disclosed and you having to pay compensation to the aggrieved party. We do not prescreen UserUploaded Content but we have the right to monitor UserUploaded Content if we wish. If we determine that any UserUploaded Content is inappropriate or otherwise objectionable, we may remove any UserUploaded Content from the Websites without any liability to you or to a third party. What this means You are responsible for the content that you upload to our websites. However, we may remove it if we think its unsuitable.

We may change the range of licences available at our discretion from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these General Terms should be read to suggest that we may not make use of your materials in accordance with the applicable ""upload"" licence. We may then apply licences to the UserUploaded Content as though we were any other user downloading your UserUploaded Content (e.g., if the applicable ""upload"" licence is wider than the licence granted to us above).

Service Design Master Class Register Now UX Courses Community Literature About IDF Log in Join our community Join us Join our Service Design Master Class Open menu Join us Log in Join our community Join us UX Courses Community Literature About IDF Reviews Why join our community For companies Frequently asked questions Contact us Terms written in human language The following page contains terms written in human language. Thats right. We decided to sit down with our lawyers and rewrite both our General Site Terms as well as our Privacy Policy from scratch. We refer to our General Site Terms and our Privacy Policy collectively as the Terms or our Terms from now on. The requirement of the rewrite of the Terms was that they should be understandable by actual humans like yourself and not contain any legalese (i.e. text that is perfectly understandable by a lawyer but will sound like nonsensical legal mumbojumbo to you). We literally spent 5 days locked in a room with our lawyers and told our lawyers that they would get a slap on the wrist and be forced to buy cake if they suggested to write legalese. Needless to say, we had a LOT of cake that week but were actually quite satisfied with the result, which you can read further below. As you will hopefully notice, these Terms are both understandable to laymen like yourself and actually quite enjoyable to read. The previous versions of our Terms were shorter and more condensed but we decided to write them in a more verbose manner in order to make them easier to understand, to be able to include examples, and to be more precise. We hope you will appreciate our efforts. Happy reading from the whole team behind the IDF.

Membership IDF currently offers three categories of paid membership to users Student, Professional and IDF Design League. Such options are available when a user registers into the Site. Users cannot sell, transfer, lease or otherwise allow unauthorized third parties to use accessuse their account. Company memberships and institutional memberships are subject to these Terms, including all further authorized individual accounts. Your IDF membership will begin on the day you finish your registration process and payment is processed through one of our payment gateways, whichever comes later, and will continue on a yeartoyear basis (in the case of the Student Membership and the Professional Membership, which are paid yearly) and a monthtomonth basis (in the case of the IDF Design League membership, which is paid monthly) unless you cancel your membership or we terminate it according to these Terms. IDF will bill your monthly or yearly membership fee to your current payment method. You must cancel your membership before it renews each year (for Student Memberships and Professional Memberships) or each month (for IDF Design League Memberships) in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's membership fees to your payment method. Any materially different or additional terms from those described in these Terms (including company and institutional memberships) will be disclosed when you create your account and signup into your membership or in other communications made available to you, including email. IDF hereby reserves the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend its offered membership plans. 15. Termination IDF will have the right to terminate your access to the Site if it reasonably believes you have breached any of the terms and conditions of these Terms. Following termination, you will not be permitted to use the Site. If your access to the Site is terminated, IDF reserves the right to exercise whatever means it deems necessary to prevent unauthorized access to the Site, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and direct contact with your Internet Service Provider. These Terms will survive indefinitely unless and until IDF chooses to terminate them, regardless of whether any account you open is terminated by you or IDF or if you have the right to access or use the Site. 16. Force Majeure, website downtime, and service outages IDF will not be liable for failing to perform under these Terms because of any event beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, a labor disturbance, an Internet outage or interruption of service, a communications outage, failure by a service provider to IDF to perform, fire, terrorism, natural disaster, or war. 17. Limitation of Actions You acknowledge and agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, relating to, or connected with your use of the Site, must be filed within one calendar year after such claim or cause of action arises, or forever be barred. 18. Billing, Payments, Refunds, Cancellation Billing. By starting your IDF membership and providing your payment method (e.g. Credit Card, PayPal account, or other payment methods introduced in the future), you hereby authorize IDF to charge and process a monthly or yearly membership fee depending on the membership type at the thenindicated current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of IDF's services. In other words, you authorize the IDF to initiate payment collection for your membership without further consent from you until you cancel (see below for information on cancellation). IDF hereby reserves the right to adjust pricing for its services or any components thereof in any manner and at any time, as determined in IDF's sole and final decision. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms, any price changes to your membership will enter into force following email notice to you. The fee for your membership service will be billed at the beginning of the paying term of your membership and each month or year thereafter (depending on whether the given membership is paid monthly or yearly). IDF reserves the right to modify or otherwise change billing dates. In the event your membership begins on a day not contained in a given month, IDF may bill your payment method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as IDF deems appropriate. Payments. Online payments for services offered through the Site are currently done by our Paypal, Stripe, and ClearhausQuickpay, collectively referred to as Payment Gateways. All Payment Gateways are external, third party payment processing vendors and their payment services and other services are subject to their respective Terms and Conditions. IDF hereby reserves the right to offer further Payment Gateways, which will be governed and subject to the respective terms and conditions of such third party payment processing vendors. IDF does NOT directly or indirectly, receive, retain, store or use your credit card information in fact it never touches the IDF servers. Your credit card data constitutes sensible personal information which will be processed by third parties not directly related to IDF. If a payment is not successfully charged, due to credit card expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your account, you shall remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the payment method, as it may be available andor updated. For certain payment methods, the issuer of your credit card or other payment method may charge you transaction fees or other charges. IDF is not responsible for such fees or charges. Please revise your payment method service provider for details. Refunds. IDF currently offers a 30 day moneyback guarantee for firsttime payments of its memberships unless of course there is a material and documented issue (like fraudulent or mischievous behaviour by you). Such material and documented issue shall be jointly considered between you and IDF, and you accept that IDF decision will be final, at its sole and absolute discretion. All other payments made to IDF are, as a general rule, not refundable. However, IDF may provide you a refund or other consideration, with the amount and form and the decision to provide it at its sole and absolute discretion. Any effectuated refund does not entitle you to further refunds or other considerations in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate IDF to provide them in the future, under any circumstance. Cancellation. You may cancel your IDF membership at any time. That can be done in two ways 1) You can delete your payment method and simply let your membership run out without adding a new payment method. We will send you a series of emails urging you to renew but if you do not respond, we will cancel your account. If you choose to cancel this way, you will continue to access your account service through the end of your monthly or yearly billing period. 2) The second method is to go to your account page and cancel your account immediately. If you manually cancel your membership, your account will close immediately as opposed to at the end of your current billing period and therefore your membership credit will be forfeited. 19. Taxes and VAT In the name of Simplicity for IDF's membersclients and the online user experience, our prices always include VAT when applicable. IDF is based in Denmark, so IDF may charge a 25 VAT on payments, depending on which originating country the member or customer is based on. 20. Ownership The Site and its services are operated by The Interaction Design Foundation, an LLC incorporated under the laws of Denmark, with its main office in Aarhus, Denmark. Address The Interaction Design Foundation Katrinebjergvej 80 8200 Aarhus N Denmark 21. Changes to the Site IDF may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, suspend, make improvements to, or discontinue any aspect, functionality, content or service of the Site, temporarily or permanently, at any time without notice to you, and IDF will not be liable for doing so. 22. Additional Terms These Terms contain the entire understanding between you and IDF regarding the use of the Site and the services of IDF, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between you and IDF relating thereto. These Terms will be binding upon each party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns. These Terms and all of your rights and obligations under them may not be assignable or transferable by you without the prior written consent of IDF. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege under these Terms. You and IDF are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employeeemployer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. 23. Legal Disputes Any dispute arising from the use of the Site or the interpretation of the terms is governed by the laws of Denmark, and shall be settled by the courts of Denmark. All communications regarding legal matters must be made in writing to The Interaction Design Foundation Katrinebjergvej 80 8200 Aarhus N Denmark Personal Data Use and Privacy Policy 1. Summary, scope, purpose The following document works like what lawyers call an agreement. In this case, it is the Privacy Policy of IDF. Before we tell you what that actually means and thus delve into the details of it, we first need to establish a few definitions so its easier for you, our dear reader, to fully understand. The first question is who this document is relevant to, i.e. the parties of this agreement. Thats fairly straightforward to answer and the parties are IDF (The Interaction Design Foundation), a nongovernmental, privately held organization located at Katrinebjergvej 80, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark. Thats us. our website visitors (i.e. a Visitor). That could be you, unless you fall into the next category called Members who unlike Visitors have a membership of the The Interaction Design Foundation. our members (i.e. a Member) who have taken up a membership with the The Interaction Design Foundation. This could be a membership as an individual Member of the The Interaction Design Foundation, a company membership (for example, when a company signs up 10 or 1000 of its employees as members of the The Interaction Design Foundation), or a membership as an individual through a free trial membership offered by the The Interaction Design Foundation. Okay, so that should be fairly straightforward When we say you in the following text, we assume that you fall into the one of the two aforementioned categories, either a Member or a Visitor. When we say we, we mean the The Interaction Design Foundation. That way, we dont have to write legalese sentences like The The Interaction Design Foundation collects and handles information about its Visitors andor Members but can instead write an understandable sentence like We collect and handle information about you. Hey. thats what we promised you that we would write these terms so that actual humans like yourself can understand them. Okay, now, lets get a bit more specific. Why do we then need this documentagreement Well, thats because we, at the The Interaction Design Foundation, collect personal data about you (i.e. our Visitors andor Members) during the normal course of our activities. We made this Privacy Policy to explain all relevant aspects of this collection and handling of your data in one place easy for you to understand. We collect and handles data about you by means of the website located at httpswww.interactiondesign.org (hereinafter referred to as the Site) andor other websites used andor controlled by us from time to time. We process your personal data collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, in accordance with applicable laws in Denmark, the EU (like the GDPR) and the US. The personal data and any information you provide us with or that we collect about you will be used, among other purposes, to maintain a register of Members and Visitors send transactional email, e.g. send you an email when you have successfully earned a Course Certificate with a copy of your Certificate supply you with any goods and services you may request from us from time to time via our Site, e.g. send you a copy of the book you bought create browsing and consumption preference profiles of you in order to make recommendations and a better user experience (UX). For example, we may serve you recommendations on which course to take on our Site or we may serve you ads on a thirdparty website (whats known as remarketing) based on the courses you have visited create databases to be used to send Visitors and Members emails with newsletters, promotions, advertising and information about our Site in accordance with your wishes and permissions. We of course never send you anything without your explicit consents and conscious optin and we make unsubscription from the given servicemaillingnewsletteretc as easy as possible (usually as a oneclick action). No hassles or sneaky methods employed By entering and using our Site, you hereby provide us with your consent for the collection, treatment and processing of your personal data according to this Privacy Policy. Wait.what Read that last sentence again Here it is By entering and using our Site, you hereby provide us with your consent for the collection, treatment and processing of your personal data according to this Privacy Policy. So, did you just consent to us doing whatever we wish with your data Nope, certainly not We know that the chances of you reading this full document are very low so we of course insert a lot of socalled road blocks where we ask you to consciously agree to these Terms before signing up for something. For example, when you sign up for our newsletter, we send you an email where we not only ask you to confirm your subscription but also include a link to these Terms to give you as much transparency as possible. In addition, we also employ a range of practices some of which are also included in the GDPR (which we will tell you about in a second) that make it easy for you to know what and why we do as we do. Edits, comments, commentaries and other contributions to our Site made or provided by you will be publicly distributed, and except in certain, very limited circumstances, will remain a permanent part of this site. If you decide to contribute to our Site, you must keep this in mind. Your contributions will be subject to our Site's Terms and Conditions and The Interaction Design Foundation's Site IPCopyright Policy . 2. The Act On Processing Of Personal Data Under ""The Act on Processing of Personal Data"", incorporated under Danish law, you may request a copy of the information we hold on you for free, by writing to our address first shown above or by emailing our Data Protection Officer Mads Soegaard on mads.soegaardinteractiondesign.org . This requirement has been repeated by the introduction of the GDPR and we have been compliant long before this law took effect on 25th of May 2018. 3. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDRP), which is a European Union (EU) regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for business by unifying the regulation within the EU. The regulation enters into effect on the 25th of May 2018 and we are fully compliant. We have made the decision to be compliant and thus collect and handle your data in accordance with the GDPR regardless of whether you are from the EU or not. So if youre from outside the EU, you can consider it as an added bonus ) 4. Data Protection Officer In order to meet the requirements of the GDPR we have appointed Mads Soegaard as a Data Protection Officer and he can be reached at mads.soegaardinteractiondesign.org if you have any issues or questions relating to data protection and privacy matters. 5. What Information Is Being Collected The general operation of our services requires us to collect certain personal information that can be divided into two groups, as per the GDPR. These groups are personal data and sensitive personal data. The The Interaction Design Foundation will ONLY collect personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc. The The Interaction Design Foundation will NEVER collect sensitive personal data, such as religious beliefs, genetic data, ethnic origin, biometric data, credit card data, etc. For example, we never store your credit card infomation and it never touches our server even for a few milliseconds. The way we ensure this is that we submit the data in the payment form directly to our payment gateway so that our payment gateway stores it for us. We only hold whats called a token and then the last 4 digits in your credit card number. That way, we dont have to worry about storing extremely sensitive information about you, which would admittedly make us very, very nervous. Another example is your password, which we would consider sensitive personal data. We don't store passwords at all but use the Bcrypt cryptographic algorithm to oneway encrypt passwords instead. That way, we only store the socalled ""hash"" of your password, which allows us to know if you are entering the correct or incorrect password but without storing the actual password on our servers. Pretty smart and secure, huh 6. Where is information stored So, where do we store your information We store information in the following locations in our database in cookies on your device at third parties listed in the Who is collecting data section 7. Who Is Collecting Data Next question Who is collecting your data Good question The following entities are collecting data through our Site The The Interaction Design Foundation (thats us and we do it for the general operation of our services) Google (for statistical, analytical, marketing and conversion tracking purposes) Stripe.com (for payment purposes) PayPal (for payment purposes) Facebook (for marketing and conversion tracking purposes) Amazon Cloudfront (for hosting purposes) Cloudflare (for hosting purposes) 8. Why Is Data Being Collected To deliver our services to you, we must collect personal and nonpersonal information from you. This information is essential for the provision and quality of our services. For example, it would be pretty impossible for us to send you a newsletter if we did not have your email address. Similarly, it would be pretty impossible for us to create a Course Certificate for you if we did not know your name. To sum up, we collect data for the following purposes for the general operation of our services including the ability to log in, to take courses, to generate certificates, to receive emails, to receive grading comments, to post in our forum, etc. for the ability to send out newsletters and other mailings for hosting, e.g. figuring out which country you are from so we can serve you faster through one of our thousands of servers in our CDN, Content Delivery Network. A CDN is a fancy word for us having a server placed geographically near you to serve our video content to you MUCH faster and avoid choppy videos. for collecting and processing your payment (if youve decided to sign up for a paid membership) for marketing thorough whats called retargetingremarketing, so that we can remind you of our great courses through ads even after you have left our website for conversion tracking, so that we can learn exactly how our Members have become our Members. It also allows us to pay commission to our partners since we can attribute certain conversions to a given partner. for statistical and analytical purposes, e.g. for purposes of user research and to make our Site easier to use 9. Data Portability You can request a copy of your personal data in order to reuse it across different IT environments. We will do a export of the data in CSV format so we hope you think commas are pretty ) Our Data Protection Officer Mads Soegaard can be contacted at mads.soegaardinteractiondesign.org with requests of this nature 10. Written Procedures For Handling Data Related Issues We and Data Protection Officer, Mads Soegaard, have written procedures in place for handling the following events right to access requests right to be forgotten requests right to rectification requests revocation of consent requests data portability requests data breaches We made these documents for the purposes of GDPR compliance. Yes, they were very boring to create but now theyre done ) Rest assured that we applied attention to detail in all of them. 11. Security Measures For Keeping Data Safe We have set up physical, technical and administrative security measures for the protection of your personal data. We undertake actions, measures and provisions in order to safeguard your data and your right to protect your personal data. As an example, we use or implement the following measures, among others We don't store passwords at all but use the Bcrypt cryptographic algorithm to oneway encrypt passwords so that we only store the socalled ""hashes"" of password. That allows us to know if you are entering the correct or incorrect password but without storing the actual password on our servers Security measures around the actual physical servers holding The Interaction Design Foundation data include 32 dieselpowered emergency generators with 2,250 kW capacity for N2 redundancy, 200,000 gallons of fuel onsite, redundant fire suppression and detection systems, armed security aroundtheclock. We have 247365 onsite management and surveillance To ensure extreme uptimes and uninterrupted service, we have 247365 continuous server health monitoring. Encrypted and incremental offserver backups for complete data security SSLencrypted traffic between your browser and the The Interaction Design Foundation platform. This encryption makes it impossible for an ISP, government, or hacker to make sense of the data being transmitted Redundant fire suppression and detection systems The The Interaction Design Foundation is PCI Compliant. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB Rigorous permission system for The Interaction Design Foundation staff. Even our own staff cannot access certain data unless given explicit permission Security precautions on the devices that The Interaction Design Foundation employees use in their daytoday responsibilities, such as password protection of devices, encryption of data, firewalls and password procedures Server replication and redundant geographically dispersed data centers across two geopolitically stable continents in case of terror attacks, nuclear explosions, wars or force majeure Versioned codebase and staging servers for rigorous testing before deployment of new features. 12. Breach Notification In the extremely unlikely event of a data breach, our Data Protection Officer will notify you, the authorities and relevant third parties of any risk within a 72hour period. 13. No Transfer Of Information Or Data We will not share any email addresses of our Members and Visitors, nor will we disclose any identifying personal data, to any third party, without your clear and unambiguous consent. Data collected by us through logging visits to our Site (e.g. originating IP, referral data, browser and platform type, traffic flows, geographical area of request) is only used in an aggregated, anonymous form, which means we will not make any further effort to personally identify our Visitors (as opposed to Members). We only use such data for server administration, fault finding, site improvement and other legitimate purposes. Aggregate (and thus nonidentifying) statistics generated from our Site may be reported as part of research results or may be published on our Site. 14. Data Collection For Visitors, i.e. Non Registered Website Visitors For nonregistered website Visitors as opposed to fully registered Members we collect data similar to most websites e.g. through Google Analytics or other products for website analytics. Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send information to a remote server. The servers that host our Site maintain access logs with the information that you send. This information is used to provide and generate statistics and analytics and to provide us with marketing and traffic data regarding our Site and other websites that link back to our Site. The data we log and store may also be used by us to solve technical problems with our Site and, in cases of abuse, and to conduct any investigate therefrom. We may also use web analytics services to understand the type of traffic received by our Site and other of our websites, in order to provide better services and to set benchmarks for our goals. For example, through Google Analytics, we record things like IP address, browsing time, length and date, sections visited, websites you accessed prior to our Site and type of browser. We do not intend to use such data to identify actual website Visitors, as mentioned in the previous section. If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity anywhere else on the Internet, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt other means to obfuscate your real IP address. Browsing our Site does not reveal your identity publicly. 15. Data Collection For Registered Members Data collection for registered Members is by necessity more extensive in order to allow our Site to function. As an example, we record, including but not limited to, the following items full name (required) email address (required) phone number (optional) address, city, zip code and country (optional) credit card information (required, but not stored on our servers) link to LinkedIn profile (optional) link to Facebook profile (optional) link to Twitter profile (optional) skype username (optional) job title (optional) name of company or organization (required for companies or organizations) VAT ID of company (optional for companies or organizations) photo (optional) name of school (optional, except for student Members) courses that the Member is enrolled in (optional) answers to questions in courses (optional) posts in the The Interaction Design Foundation forum (optional) local Groups the person has registered for (optional) IP address and country of each session (for security purposes and for server session management) Please be advised that part of this information will be shown on your Public Profile page as a means of identification by other Members and in order to generate engagement and participation by our community. We only publicly disclose data which is commonly and publicly available for most people through the Internet, such as name, profile picture, country and city of residence and links to personal social media pages and the website of each Member. The disclosure of this information on your public profile page can be controlled by you at any moment. If you do not want to disclose it, please do not add it and select the necessary privacy settings in our Site andor your social media pages. If you elect to delete part or all of your information by selecting the appropriate settings in our Site, such information will not be publicly shown through our Site If you choose to cancel your membership, or if we terminate it, we will employ what is commonly referred to as a soft delete in our database, which means that data will still be stored physically in our database but marked as deleted. We do so for the technical requirements of our relational databases and for dependent functionality such as the Local Group Rank and publications on the The Interaction Design Foundation Daily to continue to work. These functionalities depend on this data being available. For example, if you have published an article in our articles section, we want to keep showing your name as the author regardless if you cancel your membership. If you forget to renew your membership, and hence it is autocancelled, the data marked as previously deleted (i.e. soft deleted) will be used to restore your course answers, local group affiliations, course certificates and other data if you elect to renew your membership at a later point. This will prevent a permanent loss of data for you Company memberships (i.e. group memberships) also require the aforementioned data collection by us, so that it can be displayed to the pertinent company administrator (i.e. for evaluating employee compliance) 16. Right To Be Forgotten We will, of course, fulfill any request to permanently delete your data. We will erase all data (i.e. harddelete), with the exception of financial transactions and data related to financial transactions (like your name, address, invoice data, etc), since we are required by law to keep records of payment information in the case of an audit. Please contact our Data Protection Officer Mads Soegaard using the email address mads.soegaardinteractiondesign.org if you wish to make us of your right to be forgotten. Such requests may take up to 3 weeks to process since it is a manual, timeconsuming and expensive process. 17. Cookies And Other Web Beacons With the purpose of providing a better experience for you, we may use cookies or other kind of web beacons. We do this to make it convenient for you to user certain of our Site's features. For example, if you have made a choice in a dropdown menu, we may place a cookie on your computer so that we can autoselect that menu item in the dropdown menu for you in the future. If we did not do that, the userfriendliness of our Site would be poor. Okay, just to get a bit technical here for purposes of this Privacy Policy, ""cookies"" shall mean text files of information sent by a website in your computer in order to store some records and preferences; and ""web beacons"" shall mean computer code inserted into a website or email that can be used to monitor the behavior of a Visitor or Member (e.g. IP address, browsing time, length and date, sections visited, websites you accessed prior to our Site and type of browser). The Site may allow advertising or thirdparty functions that place ""cookies"" on your computer. For example, when we use Google Analytics on our website, that service also places a cookie on your computer. You may change your options through your computer equipment andor browsers to stop accepting ""cookies"" and or ""web beacons"" or confirm whether or not to accept them. Modern browsers make this very easy since privacy has become an issue that many people take an active interest in. You may also wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you want to refrain from revealing any identifying information, especially if you are using a public or shared computer. You may also prevent your browser from accepting cookies by disabling such functionality as mentioned above. 18. Advertising Opt Out We may use Google Analytics and other tools (like remarketing codes) from time to time to gather information. This allows us to provide targeted, customized advertising to Visitors. Thus, third party vendors (such as Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook) may show you our ads on certain websites across the Internet, even after you leave our Site. Such vendors may use cookies and other web beacons to track your Internet browsing in order to serve ads based on your past visits to our Site. We use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including www.google.com) to previous Visitors to our Site. If you do not wish to receive this type of advertising from us now or in the future, you may optout by using the DoubleClick optout page or the Network Advertising Initiative optout page . For Googlespecific advertisement, you can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interestbased advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin . In other words, our ads do not collect any sensitive personal data about you. For purposes of these Terms, sensitive personal data shall mean your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, tradeunion membership, data concerning health or sex life and financial data like credit card or bank information. 19. Email Communication Opt Out We use email as the preferred way of communicating with you. Without collecting email addresses and using them to communicate, it would not be possible to alert Members and Visitors when requesting a new password when new courses become available when new lessons become available when receiving grading comments when earning course certificates when sending newsletters when membership is about to expire when joining our Design Leauge when becoming part of a Local Group when a potential Member drops out of the signup process when requesting templates and template bundles when using the referafriend functionality when earning course distinctions or awards when membership has been autorenewed when the Member is a part of a company membership On the Manage notification preferences page our Members can choose to opt in or out of the different kind of emails that the we send. Furthermore, emails that the we send contain an unsubscribe link at the bottom, enabling both Members and Visitors to opt out at any time. 20. Social Media Communication Opt Out We engage in active communications through major social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Instagram. If you have previously chosen to follow or like us on a particular social media, you can log into your social media account and unfollow or remove your like of us in order to stop receiving communications on that particular social media. 21. Personal Data Release We may only release collected personal data under the following circumstances as required by applicable law (e.g. in response to a valid request from a law enforcement agency) to designated third parties, in order to resolve or investigate abuse complaints when the information is related to spiders, bots, and other technical issues when attempting to block abusive users or to complain to such Internet Service Provider to defend ourselves or our affiliates from legal claims by third parties when deemed necessary to protect the rights of our user community or our Site when requested under the Right to Access and Right to Portability provision of the GDPR, in which case Data Protection Officer Mads Soegaard can be contacted at mads.soegaardinteractiondesign.org 22.

Click here to register as an affiliate. Back Top Top Disputes Any dispute relating in any way to the Program or this Operating Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court , except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Operating Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Operating Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, Quintilone Associates, 22974 El Toro Rd 100, Lake Forest, CA 92630. The arbitration will be conducted by Judicate West under its rules, including Judicate Wests Supplementary Procedures for ConsumerRelated Disputes. Judicate Wests rules are available at www.JudicateWest.com or by calling 18004888805. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by Judicate Wests rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than 10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial . We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Operating Agreement, we may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal, or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of our or any other person or entitys intellectual property or proprietary rights. You further acknowledge and agree that our rights in the Content are of a special, unique, extraordinary character, giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be readily estimated or adequately compensated for in monetary damages.

Back Top Top Miscellaneous You acknowledge and agree that we and our affiliates may at any time (directly or indirectly) solicit customer referrals on terms that may differ from those contained in this Operating Agreement or operate sites that are similar to or compete with your site. You may not assign this Operating Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our express prior written approval. Subject to that restriction, this Operating Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Operating Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Operating Agreement.

To obtain a licence to the Kakadu Software you must agree to the licence terms and conditions for that software. The terms and conditions of use of the Kakadu Software are agreed to by you in addition to these terms and conditions rather than as a replacement of these terms and conditions, but to the extent of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and the terms of the software licence, the software licence will prevail.

Emails sent by the Website or through the Website are considered a part of the Services and are covered by these terms and conditions. 3. Warranty and indemnity Kakadu Company does not represent, warrant or guarantee that any information on the Website will be complete, reliable or accurate; or the Users access to the Website will be secure, available or uninterrupted. The User warrants to Kakadu Company that the User has the full right, authority and ability to enter into these terms and conditions, and that the User will not post information to the Website or use the Website or the Services to do anything, or for any purpose, that is (a)a breach of (i) the Competition and Consumer Law Act 2010 (Cth), Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or Spam Act 2003 (Cth) or any other law which deals with commerce online; or (ii) the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth), Designs Act 2003 (Cth), Patents Act 1990 (Cth), or any other law which deals with intellectual property; (b) a breach of any law of the Commonwealth of Australia, or any state or territory of Australia which binds the User or Kakadu Company, including criminal, personal injury, civil liability and defamation laws; or (c) may bring Kakadu Company or its Associates into disrepute or otherwise negatively impact on the reputation or business of Kakadu Company or its Assocaites.

However, to the extent permitted by law, the parties agree that any implied terms are excluded from these terms and conditions. The liability of Kakadu Company to any User for any claim under these terms and conditions must not exceed the lower of (a) the amount of fees received by Kakadu Company from the User; (b) the cost of Kakadu Company resupplying the Services; or (c) the cost of Kakadu Company repairing the Services. The limitations under this clause 4 apply to any liability, arising from any cause of action whatsoever, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such costs or damages and even if the limited remedies provided in these terms and conditions fail of their essential purpose. 5.

The User may terminate these terms and conditions at any time and for any reason by ceasing to access the Website, or suspending, terminating, deleting or otherwise ceasing to use the Services. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, termination of these terms and conditions does not terminate any accrued rights of the parties prior to termination. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, a party must pay any amounts to another party which became due for payment under these terms and conditions prior to the date of termination. 7. Disputes A party must not start court proceedings (except proceedings seeking interlocutory relief) unless it has complied with clause 11.

Each party must pay its own costs of complying with this clause 11. 8. Notices Any notice, demand, consent, approval or communication under these terms and conditions must be in writing, in English and sent by email to saleskakadusoftwar.com or to the Users email address provided. 9. Third party links and advertising The Website may display advertisements, which may or may not contain hyperlinks or buttons which take the User to websites operated by third parties.

Any interactions with a third party website are not part of the Website or included in the Services. 10. General From time to time, Kakadu Company may post updated terms and conditions to the Website. Those updated terms and conditions will apply to all use of the Website from the time of posting onwards, and continuing use of the Website will be taken to constitute agreement to the revised terms and conditions. Otherwise these terms and conditions may be altered only in writing signed by each party. A party does not waive a right, power or remedy if it fails to exercise or delays in exercising the right, power or remedy. A single or partial exercise of a right, power or remedy does not prevent another or further exercise of that or another right, power or remedy. A waiver of a right, power or remedy must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver. Except where these terms and conditions expressly state otherwise, a party may, in its discretion, give conditionally or unconditionally or withhold any approval or consent under these terms and conditions. Each party must do, at its own expense, everything reasonably necessary (including executing documents) to give full effect to these terms and conditions and the transactions contemplated by it. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under these terms and conditions without the prior written consent of the other party which may not be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment will only be effective if it is made by way of a deed of assignment and assumption between the assigning party, the continuing party and the incoming party. A term or part of a term of these terms and conditions that is illegal or unenforceable may be severed from these terms and conditions and the remaining terms or parts of the term of these terms and conditions continue in force. Any indemnity or any obligation of confidence under these terms and conditions is independent and survives termination of these terms and conditions. Any other term by its nature intended to survive termination of these terms and conditions survives termination of these terms and conditions. Except where these terms and conditions expressly states otherwise, it does not create a relationship of employment, trust, agency or partnership between the parties. Unless otherwise stated, the rights, powers and remedies provided in these terms and conditions are in addition to and not exclusive of the rights, powers and remedies given by law independently of these terms and conditions. If force majeure prevents a party from fully or partly performing any obligation under these terms and conditions (except an obligation to pay money), the affected partys obligation to perform that obligation is suspended while the force majeure continues. These terms and conditions may be executed in counterparts. All counterparts when taken together are to be taken to constitute one instrument. These terms and conditions are governed by the law of the State of New South Wales and each party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales. 11. Interpretation In these terms and conditions, except where the context otherwise requires (a) the singular includes the plural and vice versa, and a gender includes other genders; (b) another grammatical form of a defined word or expression has a corresponding meaning ; (c) a reference to a clause or schedule is to a clause of, or schedule to, these terms and conditions, and a reference to these terms and conditions includes any schedule; (d) a reference to a document or instrument includes the document or instrument as novated, altered, supplemented or replaced from time to time; (e) a reference to dollars, is to US currency or Australian currency if the User is in Australia; (f) a reference to a party is to a party to these terms and conditions, and a reference to a party to a document includes the partys executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns and substitutes; (g) a reference to a person includes a natural person, partnership, body corporate, association, governmental or local authority or agency or other entity; (h) a reference to a statute, ordinance, code or other law includes regulations and other instruments under it and consolidations, amendments, reenactments or replacements of any of them; (i) the meaning of general words is not limited by specific examples introduced by including, for example or similar expressions; (j) any agreement, representation, warranty or indemnity by two or more parties (including where two or more persons are included in the same defined term) binds them jointly and severally; (k) any agreement, representation, warranty or indemnity in favour of two or more parties (including where two or more persons are included in the same defined term) is for the benefit of them jointly and severally; and (l) a rule of construction does not apply to the disadvantage of a party because the party was responsible for the preparation of these terms and conditions or any part of it.

No Waiver of Rights by Instagram Instagram's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Instagram Platform Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

"End User License Agreement vs Terms of Service When does each apply Canadian Startup and Video Game Law Blog Canadian Startup and Video Game Law Blog Startup and video game law, from a Canadian and U.S. perspective Menu Skip to content Home Contact Voyer Law About Kellen Voyer End User License Agreement vs Terms of Service When does each apply Leave a reply This post aims to clear confusion surrounding two technology law terms Terms of Service (ToS) and End User License Agreement (EULA). Often, clients use these terms interchangeably even though the terms refer to different business models. Determining which term applies to your business will assist you when searching for legal counsel and to understand your own business model. End User License Agreement An End User License Agreement addresses the license of copyrighted software to your users. This agreement is used when users are installing or accessing computer code, such as on their phonemobile device or computer. Since users are installingaccessing code, the End User License Agreement provides users a copyright license to the code and, therein, aims to protect your rights to that code. Example a mobile application, downloaded from an app store and installed on a users device. Terms of Service A Terms of Service agreement addresses the provision of services to your users. This agreement is used when users are provided a service, typically accessed through a website, but users do not install or access code Software as a Service. While some label the provision of services as a license this is not always ideal as license is a term evoking copyright and installingaccessing computer code. Rather, the user is provided with access or a subscription to the services (or similar language). Example a SAAS service accessed from a website through a user account. But There may be instances where you combine these two documents, licensing code and providing a service. For example, an application (installed code) that connects to your cloud service to retrieve data (the service). Additionally, you may have a mobile application and web service that accomplish the same thing but exist separately and, in this case, both agreement types are required. In Sum Understanding the differences between End User License Agreements and Terms of Service should assist you with understanding your business model (am I selling software, a service, or both) and your legal needs.

By the term cloud is meant the product which works of the web site as a cloud solution. 1.7 Services means any services related to the Products that are provided by XINK to its Clients within thirty (30) days from the Effective Date of the EULA. 1.8 Support Services means any services related to the Products that are offered after thirty (30) days from the Effective Date of the EULA. 1.9 Terms and Conditions shall mean, collectively, the terms and conditions of sale and delivery, as well as terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement or such replacement terms and conditions which are in force at the date of the EULA, as well as the terms and conditions set forth on the official website at XINK.io, or any other official website related to XINK. LICENSE. 2.1 Grant of License . In consideration for the Clients continued timely payment of the license fee for the Products, XINK grants to Client a nonexclusive, nontransferable license right to access, use, and display XINKs Products. This license permits only one (1) copy of the Products on a single servercomputer unless it is understood that the Products will need to be installed on more than one servercomputer. The license shall apply to all releases and versions of the Products so long as Client has paid the license fee in full and is in compliance with the Terms and Conditions. FEES AND PAYMENTS. 3.1 License Fees . In order to access and use the Products, Client shall pay to XINK a periodic license fee for the Products andor related Services. The terms of payment for the periodic license fee will depend on whether the Client is using the onsite or cloud version of the Products. The license fee for the onsite version shall be paid annually and the initial fee will be paid contemporaneously with the execution of the EULA by Client unless the parties agree otherwise. The license fee for the cloud version shall be paid annually or monthly, as decided by the parties. If the license fee is to be paid annually, the initial fee will be paid contemporaneously with the execution of the EULA by Client unless the parties agree otherwise. All subsequent annual license fees must be paid in full by the first (1st) day of the anniversary month in which the EULA was signed, or if such day is a Saturday or Sunday, by the next business day. If the license fee is to be paid monthly, the initial fee will be paid contemporaneously with the execution of the EULA by Client unless the parties agree otherwise. Subsequent monthly fees must be paid by the fifth (5th) day of each month, or if such day is a Saturday or Sunday, by the next business day. Upon receipt of the payment in full, XINK shall deliver to Client the License Keys, at which time, the delivery is complete. License fees are subject to change at the sole discretion of XINK and without notice. Client understands and agrees that Support Services are not covered by the license fee and will be in addition to the license fee at a rate to be determined by XINK at its own discretion. 3.2 Taxes and Charges . Fees and other charges described in this Agreement do not include federal, state, or local sales, use property, excise, service, or similar taxes ( Taxes ).

Client hereby agrees to indemnify XINK for and hold it harmless from all claims and liability arising from Clients failure to report or pay such Taxes. 3.3 Payments and Delivery . 3.3.1 XINK reserves the right to determine the manner in which payment may be made, which may include without limitation, bank transfer or wire, check, or credit card, which may be payable online. 3.3.2 When paying by credit card, the credit card is first authorized to generate a transaction ID. This is not a payment guarantee. The payment is deemed complete when the charge is drawn from the credit card account. All credit card transactions are executed by XINK. 3.3.3 Once the payment has been received and completed, the License Key will be released and delivered to Client if it related to onpremises. If it is related to cloud, the service will start from the day the payment has been received. 3.3.4 The time of payment shall be of the essence for any given EULA. Should Client fail to make a payment on the due date, then without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to XINK, XINK shall be entitled to 3.3.4.1 cancel the EULA or suspend any further deliveries of Products or suspend any Services; 3.3.4.2 appropriate any payment made by Client and redirect such payment towards the delinquent amount, as XINK deems fit; andor 3.3.4.3 charge the Client with interest (both before and after judgment) on the unpaid amount. 3.4 XINK has a license server which the application has access to. If a license fee or maintenance fee remains unpaid XINK can shut down the service and hence the Products will not work anymore. The usage of the products and services rely on the annual payment. 3.4.1 If a service has been shut down due to several reminders and then the Client wants to get the service back, this can be done normal prices less a percentage determined by XINK. TERM AND TERMINATION. 4.1 Term . This Agreement and the license granted hereunder shall become effective when signed by both parties. The Agreement year shall begin as of the first (1st) day of the month in which it is signed by Client and will continue for one (1) Year (the Term) unless terminated as provided herein. 4.2 Termination without Cause . Client may terminate this Agreement and the license granted hereunder by providing notice of termination at least two (2) months prior to the start of an Agreement Year. For purposes of clarification, if this Agreement was executed on December 15, 2007, then the Agreement Year would begin starting December 1, 2007. Client must provide notice of termination on or before October 31, 2007 in order to effectively terminate this Agreement. This termination is only valid if it is confirmed by XINK and Client has paid all fees then due and owing.

In the event of any termination hereunder, Client shall not be entitled to any refund of any payments made by Client, and if Client is on a monthly payment schedule, Client shall immediately pay all monthly fees owed to XINK. 4.3 Termination with Cause . This Agreement and the license granted hereunder shall terminate (i) immediately if Client files for bankruptcy, becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) immediately upon XINKs knowledge of any violation of XINKs intellectual property and proprietary rights; (iii) immediately if Client fails to pay the license fees or fees for Support Services when due for any reason; or (iv) thirty (30) days after XINK gives Client notice of Clients material breach of any provision of the Agreement and Client has not cured such breach during such thirty (30) day period. 4.4 Duties Upon Termination . Upon any termination hereunder, Client shall immediately cease use of all XINK proprietary information and shall irretrievably delete andor remove such items from all computer hardware and storage media. Client agrees that within thirty (30) days after any termination, an officer of Clients organization shall certify in writing to XINK that it has performed the foregoing. In addition, Client understands and agrees that upon termination of this Agreement and the license hereunder for any reason, XINK shall have the right to suspend or terminate Clients account, including access by Client to all images, signatures and Products and Client agrees to remove all Products from its computer network server and system and provide XINK written confirmation once the Products have been removed.

XINK shall therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request. XINKs right to obtain injunctive relief shall not limit its right to seek further remedies. 5.4 In order to protect XINKs proprietary information, Client agrees to take all reasonable steps and the same protective precautions to protect such proprietary information from disclosure to third parties as with its own proprietary and confidential information. Neither party shall, without the other partys prior written consent, disclose, provide, or make available any of the proprietary information of the other party in any form to any person, except to its bona fide employees, officers, directors, or third parties whose access is necessary to enable such party to exercise its rights hereunder.

Your DMCA CounterNotification should contain the following information (i) a legend or subject line that says DMCA CounterNotification; (ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Sites from which the material was removed or access to it disabled); (iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; (iv) your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your account; (v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and (vi) your electronic or physical signature.

However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. We reserve the right to request at any time proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.

We do not vet Homeowners or their Projects on behalf of our users, and we will not be liable to you in respect of any Project or relationship with any Homeowner in any way. We therefore recommend that you carefully assess each Project and carry out whatever lawful checks you consider appropriate in relation to any Homeowner before undertaking any work for them. back to top Service Content The vast majority of the material on the Service originates from our users, and we rely on Homeowners to accurately describe their Project requirements. We have little or no editorial control over the material and we therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, performance or fitness for any particular purpose of the material available through the Service. We cannot accept responsibility for errors, omissions, or inaccurate material available through the Service, and make no warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted or error free, or that any defects will be corrected.

We recommend that you always use uptodate firewalls and antivirus software to protect your equipment and data. Any material you obtain from the Service is used at your own risk, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with access or use of the Service (except to the extent that such liability cannot be excluded by law). back to top Use of the Service You may not tender for any Project which is not legal or which may not legally be performed by you. A core purpose of the Service is to connect Homeowners to genuine tradespeople who wish to undertake Projects for those Homeowners. The Service is therefore not for use by tradesmen who do not intend to carry out and ensure successful completion of each Project they accept. You therefore agree that you will not in any circumstance use the Service for the purpose of reselling, exchanging or purchasing or otherwise obtaining leads from other tradesmen; pose as a Homeowner and post fake Projects whether for purposes of identifying potential tradesmen in your area with whom you may wish to work, or in order to receive information from other tradesmen about their businesses and Project proposals, or for any other purpose whatsoever. You agree that you will not use subcontractors on any Project without the prior consent of the relevant Homeowner. You are responsible for ensuring that you and your subcontractors are legally entitled to tender for and perform any Project for which you tender or accept. By using subcontractors on Projects obtained via the Service, you agree to procure that each of your subcontractors will also comply with the terms of this Agreement as if it were a party to it. You also acknowledge that you will be responsible to us and to all Homeowners for the acts and omissions of your subcontractors. We will not be a party to any contract made between you and any Homeowner and therefore we shall not be liable for any loss or damage that results from any dealings between you and any Homeowner including but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential or inconsequential loss of any kind. You agree not to use the Service in any unlawful manner and in particular shall not post any material that infringes any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of any person; post any corrupted files, files that contain viruses, or any other code that may damage the operation of a computer or other electronic device; conduct or forward surveys, contests other than in Communities (as defined below) intended for such uses, and shall not forward pyramid schemes or chain letters; download any file Posted by another user of a forum that the user knows, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner; impersonate another person or entity, or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the original or source of software or other material contained in a file that is Posted; cause the Service to be interrupted, damaged, rendered less efficient or such that the effectiveness or functionality of the Service is in any way impaired; or restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Service. You agree that you will (and will ensure that your subcontractors will) comply with the Privacy Policy ; the Payment Terms ; and the Trade Business Code of Conduct We may notify you of Projects from time to time, but we are not under any obligation to do so. Further, because Homeowners retain the right to change or withdraw their Project from our Service, we are unable to give any warranty as to the availability or suitability of a particular Project. We do not review or confirm the accuracy of all details provided to us by Homeowners, and we therefore cannot guarantee that all leads include correct and complete information. Further, we cannot guarantee that any leads generated using the Service will result in business for you, and no refund is offered in the event that you do not obtain business from the leads generated. back to top Behaviour You agree not to use the Service in any unlawful manner and in particular shall not defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (including rights of privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate (Post) any inappropriate, defamatory, abusive, infringing, obscene, discriminatory or otherwise unlawful material. back to top Payments You agree to pay the fees for using the Service in accordance with the Payment Terms and as more specifically set out in the tariff of charges in the Membership Confirmation. back to top Member benefits premium If youve subscribed to one of our new annual tariffs (as of June 7th 2016) youll have access to member benefits premium service (the benefits service).

We cannot accept liability for any loss or damage that may be suffered as a result of following any links. You agree not to Post links to any websites. The Service contains discussion forums, bulletin board services, chat areas, communities andor other message or communication facilities (collectively Communities ). Although our hope is that all users will use the Service responsibly, and we require all users to ensure that all content that they post on the Service is lawful, we are not responsible for reviewing or policing user content and so it is possible that Communities may carry offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. We urge you to exercise proper judgement and to use caution and common sense when using Communities. We do not control the information delivered to the Communities, and have no obligation to monitor the Communities. You are responsible for your own communications and for any consequences arising out of them. The Communities are intended to allow users to send and receive messages and material that are legal, proper and related to the particular Community, and you agree that you shall use them only for this purpose. We do not guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications Posted in the Communities or endorse any opinions expressed in the Communities. You should take all due care in relying on material Posted in the Communities, as this is done at your own risk. It is important for you to note that all Communities are public, and that others may read communications made via the Community without the authors knowledge. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself in any Community, and do not give personally identifying information about any other person unless entitled to do so. back to top Use of Information You are solely responsible for the content, accuracy, and completeness of the Trade Business Information, and agree only to provide true, accurate, current and complete information. You also accept all liability arising out of or in connection with your processing and transmission of the Homeowner Information. You acknowledge that we may edit, modify or remove any parts of Trade Business Information which we consider is in breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, andor suspend or terminate your access to the Service without notice.

We check the information that you provide on registration and during your continued use of the Service.

You consent to information about the device you use to access the Service and verification, identity and address documentation being collected and processed for fraud prevention purposes and we may use third parties (and information they provide) to help us prevent fraud or unauthorised access to our Service. You agree not to copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute or publicly display any content (except for your Trade Business Information) from the Service without our prior written permission. To the extent that we provide you with Homeowner Information, you agree that you shall treat the Homeowner Information as confidential and not share the information with any other person; only use the Homeowner Information for the purpose of contacting them in relation to the particular Project for which you were provided with the information, and for no other purpose whatsoever; at all times and in all respects comply with data protection law. back to top Arrangements with Homeowners Our rating system is designed to provide Homeowners with independent feedback on the quality, value and reliability of trade businesses. Furthermore, your willingness to be rated may provide Homeowners with a level of confidence regarding the Trade Business ability. A key reason that Projects are made available through the Service is that Homeowners are able to read reviews by your previous customers. You therefore agree that your performance in carrying out each Project may be rated and reviewed by the applicable Homeowner and that the ratings and reviews will be published on the Service. Should you (or any of your subcontractors) have a dispute with a Homeowner, you must address such dispute directly to the Homeowner concerned. However, you agree to notify the details of the dispute to us as soon as reasonably practicable. We may decide to investigate any grievances held by you or by Homeowners and may discuss any such investigation with all involved parties. We may take any lawful action we deem necessary in the event of a grievance, but likely outcomes of a grievance investigation include you and the Homeowner being allowed to continue using the Service; your andor the Homeowners access to the Service being suspended for a period of time; your andor the Homeowners access to the Service being terminated and banned for a definite or indefinite period. In the event of a suspension or termination, no further fees shall accrue to the extent that access to the Service is suspended or terminated. However, any fees already accrued shall become immediately payable. Save as provided above, we cannot be involved in your dealings with Homeowners and, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Homeowners, you hereby release (and shall procure that your subcontractors release) us from any and all claims, demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. back to top Trade Qualifications and Certification Where you advise us that you (or your subcontractors) are Part P, gas, or otherwise certified, we may verify the relevant certification. However the validity of the certificate always remains your responsibility. We advise Homeowners to request sight of evidence of applicable trade accreditations or registrations, CRB checks and solvency checks (as applicable) prior to work commencing on a Project. You agree to comply with any reasonable requests submitted by the Homeowners with regards to the verification of such accreditations, registrations or information. Any checks on trade accreditations or registrations that we carry out do not reduce your obligation to ensure that all your subcontractors and any personnel involved in the Project have the required trade accreditation or registration to carry out specific aspects of the Project. back to top Ask an Expert We may invite you to participate in Ask an Expert if you are a member of Rated People and have received a total of 5 or more ratings from our Homeowners, with an average rating from our Homeowners of 4.5 stars or above.

Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our Cookies Policy . Meetups SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend facetoface meetings at venues all over the world ( Meetups ).

Use of SoundCloud players and widget The Platform includes access to customizable players ( Players ), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player ( Widget ) for incorporation into users own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader. You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget.

SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.

"COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) GUIDE Included Overview Dos and Donts Checklist Copyright License Agreement (Written Work) Instructions Sample Copyright License Agreement (Written Work) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 1 1. Overview An organizations ability to buy and sell property is essential to its longterm life and vitality. Although it does not take up physical space, an excess of intellectual property can burden a company, directing limited funds towards maintaining registrations, defending against thirdparty claims, or creating and marketing fnal products. Licensing intellectual property can have an immediate positive effect on a companys fnances, generating revenue and decreasing costs. A company looking to obtain a license in property (including written materials) must be sure that the licensor does, in fact, have title to the desired items. A properlydrafted copyright license agreement can help in both circumstances. A nonexclusive copyright license agreement allows the licensee to use (but not own) the owners creative works. Licensing can help a company obtain rights needed to sell or manufacture its own products effectively and easily, while lending the licensee an established name and reputation. The marketing efforts made by the licensee will in turn beneft the licensors works and reputation. Use the enclosed document to license a copyrighted written work for use by another party. You can provide detailed information about how the material will be used and the extent of its incorporation into a publication or other work. The copyright holder will know that its rights are protected, and the licensee will be well on its way to getting rights to material needed to complete its work. 2. Dos Donts Checklist A copyright is a form of protection provided by federal law to creators of original works of authorship. This includes literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, both published and unpublished. The author of a copyrighted work can prevent others from copying, performing, or using the work without its consent. Because of this, any third party intending to reprint a portion of the copyrighted work must first obtain the permission of the Licensor. Failure to do so could result in a lawsuit and substantial fines. Note that in copyright law, an exclusive license essentially works as a transfer of ownership rights. The exclusive licensee has the right to use the copyright, assign it to a third party, or sue a third party for infringement. A nonexclusive licensee also has the right to use the copyright, but neither of the other two rights. Not every use of another persons copyrighted material will be considered a copyright violation. There is a concept in American copyright law called fair use, which allows third parties to use copyrighted works without permission if that use is for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. There are other factors involved in assessing whether unauthorized use is fair use (including the purpose of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect of the use on the market or value of the copyrighted work), and its not always an easy or clear determination. The best practice is to obtain permission from a copyright holder in every context, rather than risk the damages and costs that could result from a lawsuit. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 1 2 Another type of material that does not require permission to republish is work existing in the public domain. A work in the public domain is not simply a work that is publicly available; it is a work that is either not currently or never was protected by copyright. Public domain works generally fall into one of the following categories General information (e.g., facts or numbers) Materials created by the U.S. government Items that had copyrights that expired because of time or because the holder didnt renew the copyright Materials created before 1989 that lacked proper copyright notices Determining who holds the copyright in a given work can be complicated, but there are certain basic steps that can help in most situations. If you are using material initially published in a book, the copyright holder may be listed on the page after the title page. If you are using material initially published in a journal or periodical, contact the publisher of the work (which usually owns the copyright in all of that works contents). Information on the publisher of a journal or periodical can usually be found in the masthead. If you cannot find information on the copyright holder of the material you wish to reprint, contact the U.S. Copyright Office or review the archives available on its website (www.copyright.gov). A copyright license is typically accomplished through a contract, like the written agreement form that follows. Although not technically required, licenses can also be recorded with the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) to provide notice of the documents existence. The advantage of this recording is that it provides a public record of the license and may establish priority rights if there is a dispute about whether or not a transfer is valid. No special forms are needed for recordation, although the USCO does encourage registrants to use a Document Cover Sheet to facilitate such recordings. If you decide to file a Document Cover Sheet, provide at least two (2) copies of this form with the license itself. There will be a fee for this recording (currently 95 for each title). A copyright license does not have to be forever and does not need to be a complete or exclusive license. You can grant a transfer for a specific period of time, in a specific area, or for a specific medium (e.g., allow online use but not film use). Both parties should review the completed agreement carefully to ensure that all relevant deal points have been included. It is better to be overinclusive than underinclusive. Do not assume that certain expectations or terms are agreed to if they are not stated expressly in the document. Sign at least two copies of the agreement, one for you and one for the other party. Its a good idea to have the agreement notarized or witnessed. This will limit later challenges to the validity of a partys signature. If your agreement is complicated, or if you dont understand its uses or requirements, do not use the enclosed form. Contact an attorney to help you draft a document that will meet your specific needs. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 2 3 3. Copyright License Agreement (Written Work) Instructions The following provisionbyprovision instructions will help you understand the terms of your agreement. The numbers and letters below (e.g., Section 1, Section 2(a), etc.) correspond to the provisions in the contract. Please review the entire document before starting your stepbystep process. Introduction of Parties. Identifes the document as a copyright license agreement. Write in the date on which the agreement is signed. Identify the parties and, if applicable, what type of organization(s) they are. Note that each party is given a name (e.g., Licensor) that will be used throughout the agreement. As you probably guessed, the Licensor is the party that owns the copyright and is giving permission (or license) to use the underlying material and the Licensee is the party that asked for permission to use that material. Recitals. The whereas clauses, referred to as recitals, defne the world of the agreement and offer key background information about the Parties. In this document, the recitals include a simple statement of the intent to license rights in the Material. In the space provided, give specifc details about the Material that will be reprinted. Include reference to the chapter, page, line opening and closing words, and approximate number of words. If you want to enclose a copy of the Material for the Licensors convenience, keep the bracketed clause and attach a copy to the Agreement as Exhibit A. If you do not intend to do so or if it isnt necessary because of information youve already provided delete the bracketed words. Section 1 Grant of License. The extension and acceptance of the license of the copyrights (and therefore the right to reproduce and distribute the Material).

(a) Write in the title of the publication that will reprint the previouslypublished Material. Include any additional information about the author, editor, or compiler of the new work, and the publisher and its address. Write down the publication type (e.g., trade edition, paperback, hardback, CD Rom, DVD, Intranet, magnetic media, etc.) and as many other details as possible about the new publication. For example, consider providing relevant information about Publication date(s) Expected retail price Total expected sales (or distribution) for the (edition of) publication No. of pages (entire publication) No. of pages (requested material) No. of printed copies Circulation (e.g., countries, special markets, etc.) (b) Describe how and where the Material can be used. For example, will the Licensee be allowed to perform the Material Use it in advertising Be sure to include any relevant limitations on how the Material can be used. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 3 4 Section 2 No Assignment or Transfer. Unlike an assignment, in which an owners entire interest is transferred to the buyer, this Agreement gives the Licensee only specifc, listed rights. The Licensee is not permitted to resell or transfer its rights, which are only partially and temporarily provided. This section reiterates that fact, and requires the Licensee to obtain the Licensors written permission if it wants to do an assignment or transfer. (Optional) Section 3 Territory. Delimits the geographical area in which the Licensee can use the Material. This is an optional section and gives the Licensor the ability to further restrict the rights it is giving to the Licensee. If this section is not included, the Licensee (subject to the terms of the Agreement) will be able to use the Material without any physical restrictions (i.e., anywhere it wants). If you remove this section, correct the section numbers and the references in the document. Section 4 Restrictions. (a) Limited Use. Allows the Licensee to use the Material only in the ways specifcally stated in the Agreement. Any use beyond that is considered against the law. (b) No Modifcation. The Licensee cant revise the Material in any way. (c) Right of Review. The Licensor can review an entire Collective or Derivative Work if the Material constitutes more than 10 of that work. Feel free to increase or decrease this percentage amount to better suit your agreement. (d) Limitations on Transfer. Reiterates that the transfer is of certain rights only. Section 5 Credit and Samples. (a) Credit. Allows the Parties to specify how the Licensor will be credited on the Licensees use of the Material. Use the space provided to show how you want the copyright credit to look (e.g., Reproduced with permission from Licensor BookTitleetc (Year). Copyright Year, Licensor.) (b) Credit of Licensor in Collective or Derivative Work. Explains that credit must still be given to the Licensor or the author in any publications that use the Material as a jumping off point. (c) Copy of Collective or Derivative Work. The Licensee must give the Licensor a copy of any Collective Work or Derivative Work to show it didnt go beyond the terms of the Agreement. (d) Copies of Advertisements. The Licensee must give the Licensor two copies of any ads used to promote the Material. (e) Copy of Critical Work. The Licensee must give the Licensor a copy of any writing that criticizes the Material if that criticism is going to be a part of the fnal Collective Work or Derivative Work. Section 6 Fees. In most agreements, each party is expected to do something. This obligation may be to perform a service, transfer ownership of property, or pay money. In this case, the Licensee is giving money (sometimes called consideration) to be able to use the Licensors property. There are two options provided and you should select the one that best suits your arrangement. In the frst, the amount the Licensor receives will be directly tied to the Licensees sales. This is more applicable to a large commercial venture and may not be appropriate for small journals or other limited editions. License Issue Fee. This subsection provides for an initial payment by the Licensee for the ability to use the Material. Enter the amount of this frst payment. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 4 5 Royalties. This is the meat of the payment that the Licensor will receive under this Agreement, if it selects the frst option. Essentially, the Licensee will pay a percentage of every sale it makes using the Material to the Licensor. You can change this to be a perunit royalty (i.e., a set fee every time a sale is made) or make the percentage rate variable (e.g., increasing over time based on an assumption that sales will increase over time). This is a matter of negotiation between the Parties and you should discuss which arrangement will best suit you. If you select the model provided, enter the percentage that the Licensee will pay to the Licensor on these sales. The royalty payments are scheduled to be reported and paid quarterly under the terms of this subsection. If you want these payments to be more frequent (e.g., monthly), change this sentence to ft your agreement. Minimum Royalty. To make sure the Licensor receives at least something every year in exchange for its agreement to let the Licensee use its Material, this subsection establishes a minimum annual payment. Enter the amount of the minimum you want to establish. Note that if this payment is not made, the Licensor has the right to terminate the Agreement. In the second option, the Licensor will receive a set payment in exchange for the license its providing. The Parties can make this a onetime lumpsum fee or a set of installment payments made over time. A set fee structure will limit the amount of reporting and bookkeeping that need to be done on both sides, but may or may not be as lucrative for the Licensor. You can also choose to designate when this fat fee will be paid (e.g., on the date the Agreement is signed or the date on which the Material is republished, or some other designated date). Select the option that best suits your arrangement and preferences, and delete the other. Section 7 Maintenance of Records and Audit Rights. Books and Records. Requires the Licensee to keep accurate books and records about sales made pursuant to this Agreement. This is particularly important when the Parties have decided to compensate the Licensor with royalty payments. To make sure that the Licensor is receiving its due share of the sales the Licensee makes of a work that incorporates the Material, it is given the right under this subsection to review the Licensees books. (include only if select Option 1 in Section 6) Underpayment of Royalties. Indicates that if the Licensee pays less than what is due in royalties, it will be required to pay that amount with interest to the Licensor. (include only if select Option 1 in Section 6) Overpayment of Royalties. Indicates that if the Licensee pays more than what is due in royalties, it is entitled to deduct the amount of the overpayment from future royalties owed. If the overpayment came at the end of the term of the Agreement, the Licensor will simply return the money to the Licensee. Section 8 Delivery of Material. Allows the Parties to specify how the Material will be provided to the Licensee. You may select as many of these as you want. Section 9 Ownership and Use of Material. (a) Ownership of Work. Reiterates that the Licensor is the owner of the copyright in the Material, and that no transfer of that ownership is taking place under this Agreement. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 5 6 (b) Validity of Registrations. The Licensees acknowledgment that the copyright registrations in the Material are valid. (c) Limitation on Actions. States that the Licensee will not challenge the Licensors copyright registrations, or help a third party make a challenge against them. Section 10 Representations and Warranties. Each Partys promises that certain things are true (or will be true) to motivate the other Party to enter into the Agreement. The frst three relate to both Parties essentially, both are stating that they have the right to enter into the Agreement and that doing so wont violate any contract theyre a part of. The second section relates to the Licensors promises about the material being licensed. More specifcally, the Licensor is swearing that 10(A) it is the only person or company that has the authority to license the Material. 10(B) it can give permission to use the Material. Note that there is an exception carved out for any writing or quotations embedded in the Material. If there is any such writing, separate permission will need to be obtained from the author or Licensor of that embedded material. 10(C) the Material is not copied from anywhere, and has not fallen into the public domain (either because of failure to maintain the copyright or by expiration). 10(D) it has not already sold or transferred all of its rights in the Material to any third party. 10(E) does not believe that the Material has been taken from any third party without authorization (e.g., deliberate plagiarism of another writers work). 10(F) does not know of any permissions that have to be obtained in order for the license to be granted. In other words, once the Agreement is signed, the grant will be effective without anyone elses input. 10(G) the Material wasnt created while the creator was employed by a third party. In many cases, if an individual was employed by a company and came up with certain material, the company will own that material. This section offers assurance to the Licensees that there are no companies that will make that claim about the Material. If the Parties want to include additional representations and warranties, you can do so here. Section 11 Documentation. This section relates to the recording of the Agreement with the U.S. Copyright Offce. Recording here simply means sending a copy of the Agreement (together with a cover sheet) to that agency. The Agreement is valid even if you dont record it. However, providing notice that the Licensee has the right to use the Material can protect it from infringement claims or claims by third parties licensees that they did not know about any other partys rights. Recordation. The Licensors promise to help with any paperwork needed to complete or record the license (e.g., fling information about the license with the Copyright Offce). The bracketed phrases make the additional promise that the Licensor will help with paperwork for flings outside of the country. If this is not relevant to your agreement, delete the bracketed phrases. Licensee Assistance in Maintaining Copyrights. The Licensees promise that it will assist the Licensor in maintaining the copyright registrations of and in the Material. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 6 7 Section 12 Indemnifcation. A description of each Partys future obligations if the Material is found to infringe on a third partys rights. There are two options provided and you should choose the one that best fts your situation. In the frst, the Licensor takes all responsibility for infringement, promising to pay all expenses and costs relating to the claim. In the second, the Licensor makes its responsibilities conditional, greatly limiting its obligations if a claim is brought. Select only one of these options, and delete the other. Section 13 Termination. Explains that some actions or events, including certain wrongful actions on the part of the Licensee, will cause the Agreement to end early. (a) Termination Procedures. Note that there are specifc actions that will automatically terminate the Agreement. These are all actions that relate specifcally to the Licensees use (or nonuse) of the Material, and this provision allows the Licensor to maintain control over (and protect the value of) its property. (b) Effect of Termination. Provides that after the termination of the Agreement for any reason, the Licensee must stop using the Material, any Collective Work, or any Derivative Work. If there are already printed books or periodicals, the Licensee can sell those for a certain period of time. Enter the amount of time the Licensee has to make those additional sales. Note that there is an optional bracketed provision, which is applicable only if you selected the royalty form of payment in Section 6. This provision says that should the Licensee sells existing preprinted Materials, Collective Works, or Derivative Works, the Licensor gets royalties from those sales. Delete this clause if it doesnt suit your arrangement. Section 14 Successors and Assigns. States that the Parties rights and obligations will be passed on to successor organizations (if any), or organizations to which rights and obligations have been permissibly assigned. Section 15 No Implied Waiver. Explains that even if one Party allows the other to ignore break an obligation under the Agreement, it does not mean that Party waives any future rights to require the other to fulfll those (or any other) obligations. Section 16 No Agency Relationship. Explains that the Parties are not in an agency relationship or any other relationship except for that of a licensor and a licensee. This is an important legal distinction, and is emphasized in this Agreement so that additional obligations are not pushed onto the Parties by law. Section 17 Notice. Lists the addresses to which all offcial or legal correspondence should be delivered. Write in a mailing address for both the Licensee and the Licensor. Section 18 Governing Law. Allows the Parties to choose the state laws that will be used to interpret the document. Note that this is not a venue provision. The included language will not impact where a potential claim can be brought. Write the applicable state in the blank provided. Section 19 Counterparts Electronic Signatures. The title of this provision sounds complicated, but it is simple to explain it says that even if the Parties sign the Agreement in different locations or use electronic devices to transmit signatures (e.g., fax machines or computers), all of the separate pieces will be considered part of the same agreement. In a modern world where signing parties are often not in the same city much less the same room this provision ensures that business can be transacted effciently, without sacrifcing the validity of the agreement as a whole. COPYRIGHT LICENSE AGREEMENT (WRITTEN WORK) LEGALZOOM.COM, INC. 2008 7 8 Section 20 Severability. Protects the terms of the Agreement as a whole, even if one part is later invalidated. For example, if a state law is passed prohibiting choiceoflaw clauses, it will not undo the entire Agreement. Instead, only the section dealing with choice of law would be invalidated, leaving the remainder of the agreement enforceable. Section 21 Entire Agreement. The Parties agreement that the document theyre signing is the agreement about the issues involved. Unfortunately, the inclusion of this provision will not prevent a party from arguing that other enforceable promises exist, but it will provide you some protection from these claims. Section 22 Headings. Notes that the headings at the beginning of each section are meant to organize the document, and should not be considered operational parts of the agreement.
